# UbU Design

Status: Draft / active pre-MVP dogfooding  
Repository: `ubu-design`  
Purpose: Canonical public design document for the UbU project

---

## 1. Overview

**UbU** is a privacy-first planning, coordination, and self-governance system.

UbU takes messy real-world inputs—tasks, calendar events, messages, external events, user preferences, physical/emotional state, integration data, realtime interaction streams, and agent or worker outputs—and turns them into explicit, inspectable, recalculable Plans.

UbU is not merely a task list or calendar application. It is intended to become a personal and organizational planning kernel: a system that models desired outcomes, constraints, risks, dependencies, available time, and human limitations, then helps determine what should happen next.

The first MVP is designed around **dogfooding**: using UbU to coordinate the design, development, release, and maintenance of UbU itself.

Recent LLM and agentic-AI changes reinforce UbU's core boundary: realtime, multimodal, tool-using, memory-bearing models are valuable interaction and extraction backends, but UbU remains the user-sovereign state-transition, planning, logging, privacy, and review layer.

For Phase 1, UbU must also be understandable as a first-person user experience. The minimal user-facing loop is: answer a small number of bootstrapping questions, allow UbU to construct an initial context model, receive one recommended next Task, inspect why that Task matters now, act or override, then let UbU learn from the result through Logs, Snapshots, and recalculation.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 User sovereignty

The user is the final authority over what the user wants and what occurred.

UbU may recommend, infer, estimate, warn, and automate, but it must not override user sovereignty.

User overrides are authoritative, but not necessarily consistent. Two forms of consistency matter:

- **Logistical consistency**: hard consistency required by the data model and planner.
- **Philosophical consistency**: broader consistency between the user’s stated goals and actual behavior.

UbU may reject or require repair of logistical contradictions. Philosophical contradictions are allowed and may be surfaced later through reporting.

Example:

- A user cannot maintain an active preference cycle such as `A > B`, `B > C`, `C > A`.
- A user may state an Objective like “communicate more with X” and later ignore a message from X. That is philosophically meaningful, but not a data-model violation.

### 2.2 Explicit value

Value must be explicit in the UbU data model.

Value is attached to **Objectives** through user-defined **Preferences**. Numeric “utils” may be derived for plan scoring, but these are transient computational artifacts, not canonical facts about the user.

UbU should not expose derived utility as if it were the user's real value. User-facing value formation should rely on direct Preference statements, review, reflection, examples, and later correction.

LLMs may estimate or suggest value-related structures, but AI-generated value is non-canonical unless accepted through UbU’s explicit model.

#### 2.2.1 Preference calibration

Phase 1 may use preference-calibration examples during onboarding, Calendar preview, and Log review. These examples describe common situations, likely emotional costs, likely emotional rewards, and plausible tradeoffs so the user can make more thoughtful Preference judgments.

Examples are not canonical Preferences. They are prompts for self-reporting. A calibration example becomes canonical only if the user accepts, edits, or answers it in a way that UbU records as a Preference, Snapshot, Log entry, Objective annotation, or review note.

Preference calibration should reduce shallow, reactive, or situationally distorted guesses without manipulating the user into a hidden value model. The user remains the final authority over Preferences.

### 2.3 Explicit planning

Planning must remain explicit and constraint-based.

UbU should model:

- Tasks
- dependencies
- preconditions
- effects
- Objectives
- Preferences
- UniverseState
- Plans
- Calendars
- external events
- decision/recalculation triggers

LLMs may assist, but the canonical planning and decision logic must remain explicit and recalculable outside the LLM.

### 2.4 Privacy-first architecture

UbU is designed around privacy, local-first operation, compartmentalized data, multiple Identities, and user-controlled sharing.

Sensitive data must not leak merely because structural planning metadata is useful.

### 2.5 Affect-aware planning

Human beings are not machines.

In `user_mode`, affective state is part of the planning problem. Energy, stress, tiredness, mood, and related human limitations are constraints that planning must respect.

UbU should not assume that users can simply execute arbitrary work because a schedule says they should.

### 2.5.1 Human-complete planning quality

UbU treats affect as a core part of planning, not a decorative wellness feature.

A plan that ignores fatigue, stress, boredom, motivation, emotional load, recovery, and dignity is not merely incomplete. It may become actively misleading.

A high-quality plan should:

- produce fast feedback about success or failure;
- make failure informative rather than humiliating;
- suggest revision after failure;
- respect the user’s dignity;
- respect emotional and physical limits;
- distinguish sustainable stretch from destructive pressure;
- help the user grow beyond current limitations when appropriate;
- remain recalculable when reality contradicts the model.

The goal is neither comfort-maximization nor coercive productivity. The goal is humane self-governance: disciplined action that respects the user’s emotional and physical reality.

For Phase 1, UbU models this as a derived `human_complete_plan_quality` assessment rather than a new first-class canonical object.

Phase 1 plan-quality analysis is derived from the candidate Plan, current affect Snapshot, Task duration and success estimates, modeled affect deltas, Log history, and user overrides. It may be cached with Plan/risk-report artifacts, but it is recalculable and non-canonical.

The minimum Phase 1 signals are:

- `feedback_latency`: expected time until the Plan produces observable evidence through Task completion, Task failure, a blocked precondition, an affect Snapshot, a user override, or an External Event.
- `checkpoint_coverage`: whether important work windows contain a near-term observation point instead of relying on end-of-day hindsight.
- `affect_margin`: how close the Plan comes to configured energy, stress, tiredness, mood, and recovery limits.
- `failure_pattern`: whether recent failures point to wrong estimates, missing dependencies, stale affect data, interruption, overload, or a changed Objective rather than a character judgment about the user.
- `stretch_pressure`: a derived label of `comfort`, `sustainable_stretch`, or `destructive_pressure`.
- `post_plan_state_delta`: whether completing the Plan is expected to leave the user better off, neutral, depleted, or at elevated risk despite nominal task completion.

Informative failure is failure that improves the model: it shortens future feedback loops, reveals an unmodeled constraint, updates duration or success estimates, or changes the next Plan. Humiliating or demoralizing failure is indicated by repeated overload, repeated late discovery, avoidable public exposure, dignity-risking wording or presentation, or a pattern where the same user-limits are ignored after they have been observed.

UbU should present failed execution as a failed plan assumption or changed world state unless the user explicitly records another interpretation. Suggested improvements should be framed as model repairs, constraint changes, smaller Tasks, added checkpoints, revised timing, recovery, clarification, delegation, or Objective reconsideration.

Sustainable stretch means a Plan asks for more than the user's current baseline while retaining near-term feedback, recovery margin, and a plausible improvement path. Destructive pressure means the Plan depends on overriding observed limits, lacks recovery, hides failure until too late, repeatedly requires success above observed capacity, or leaves the user worse off even if tasks are completed.

Post-MVP work may add richer growth models, personalized baseline learning, longitudinal dignity and morale trend reports, and UI-specific coaching language. Phase 1 only needs derived assessment, risk-report findings, recalculation triggers, and non-blaming revision suggestions.

### 2.6 Release Outreach Pipeline

The Release Outreach Pipeline is an accepted future feature bundle with the tagline:

> UbU should make every release explain itself.

Release management should not stop at code, tests, changelogs, and deployment artifacts. For UbU-runs-UbU, every meaningful minor release should also create reviewable explanation artifacts for the audiences affected by the release. These artifacts may include user-facing release notes, developer-facing release notes, screenshots, scripted UI-demo captures, short video scripts, narration text, captions, YouTube descriptions, thumbnail concepts, public posts, known-limitations summaries, and contributor calls-to-action.

The pipeline is a communication Objective implemented through ordinary UbU primitives: Objectives, Techniques, WorkItems, Logs, Automation Worker outputs, release artifacts, and export/projection gates. A later implementation may add specialized schemas for release artifacts or communication objectives, but the design requirement does not depend on a new first-class MVP entity.

Release outreach must be evidence-bound. Generated claims should be traceable to implemented features, accepted design decisions, closed issues, release notes, automated UI screenshots, demo recordings, or clearly labeled future plans. The pipeline should not let AI-generated video scripts drift into unsupported hype.

Publication is gated by default. UbU may draft, assemble, render, and prepare release communication artifacts automatically, but uploading to YouTube, publishing posts, sending announcements, or mutating external public channels should require explicit human approval unless a project has configured a narrow trusted auto-publication rule.

The Release Outreach Pipeline is not UbU-specific marketing glue. It is intended to generalize to project-management configurations: open-source projects, research groups, internal teams, product teams, community projects, and personal projects may all define communication Objectives that explain progress to their relevant audiences.

### 2.7 First-person legibility

UbU must be legible to users who do not think in programming, planning theory, or project-management jargon. The system may use explicit internal objects such as Objectives, Tasks, Plans, Logs, UniverseState, Compartments, and Snapshots, but the first user-facing experience should make the core loop obvious:

1. What matters?
2. What is true now?
3. What should I do next?
4. Why this action?
5. What happened when I tried?
6. What should change in the model?

For Phase 1, first-person legibility is implemented through a minimal bootstrap interview and next-action focus mode. These are UX requirements over existing core objects, not new canonical ontology objects.

Calendar preview and Log review are also first-person legibility requirements. They are notable Tasks that should run regularly so the user can inspect what UbU is about to recommend, compare planned behavior against actual behavior, correct mistaken assumptions, and decide whether Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, affect Snapshots, or estimates need revision.

### 2.8 Dogfooding

UbU should be useful for managing its own development.

The Phase 1 MVP should coordinate UbU’s GitHub issues, pull requests, reviews, CI events, release milestones, design questions, and contributor interactions.

### 2.9 LLM boundary

LLMs are useful but bounded.

LLMs may serve as:

- planning oracles,
- advisory systems,
- screenshot/UI interpreters,
- external workflow assistants,
- value-reflection assistants,
- document summarizers,
- automation helpers.

LLMs must not be the canonical real-time decision engine.

Short-turnaround execution decisions should be computed by UbU’s explicit decision logic.

---


### 2.10 Associations and organizational introspection

UbU models formal and informal organizations as **Associations**: Identity-scoped, perspective-bound coordination structures that emerge from Relationships, shared Objectives, commitments, norms, Logs, External References, and evidence.

An Association is not assumed to be a globally objective object with an authoritative member list. A legal entity, GitHub organization, Discord server, website, conference event, or skill network may provide strong External References, but it does not eliminate the need for perspective-bound modeling and attestations.

Organizational introspection is a first-class UbU feature. For individuals, UbU asks whether actual behavior matches stated Objectives and values. For Associations, UbU asks whether actual work, decisions, resource allocation, overrides, and undocumented structure match the Association's declared mission, values, and commitments.

LLMs may help extract candidate AssociationAttestations from permitted evidence-bearing records, but the generated claims remain reviewable, provenance-backed, confidence-scored, and disputable.

### 2.11 Cloud LLM provider boundary

Cloud LLMs are optional execution providers, not the canonical UbU brain.

The core model should support provider-neutral routing across local model providers, user-configured BYOK cloud APIs, user-owned remote workers, optional UbUCorp managed gateways, and future compatible providers. External/cloud routing must remain governed by Compartment policy, context minimization, redaction where appropriate, cost policy, provenance, and user-visible disclosure.

Local-first operation remains the philosophical baseline. Cloud LLM use may improve performance and scalability, but it must not become a hidden dependency of the FOSS core or a way to bypass `no_cloud_llm` Compartments.

---


### 2.12 Context-rich messaging and legacy communication upgrade

UbU should treat messages as planning-relevant communication events, not merely flat text strings.

A normal WhatsApp, SMS, Discord, IRC, Slack, Matrix, or email message often lacks explicit context. The context exists in the sender's intent, the recipient's Relationship history, the channel purpose, the Association involved, the current Objective, the implied Task, the expected response time, and the consequences of ignoring or delaying the message.

UbU should eventually support **context-rich asynchronous messaging** in which a message may carry a bounded metadata envelope: message kind, topic, related Objective or Task, related Association, priority, interrupt recommendation, response expectation, assumptions, ambiguities, provenance, and disclosure policy.

For Phase 3, a minimal version of this is a premier feature because it allows a receiving UbU instance to decide whether the message should interrupt an existing Plan, become a Task, update an Objective, or wait for a normal communication-review window.

Legacy-system integration can still provide value before native UbU-to-UbU messaging exists. UbU may ingest flat legacy messages and use a structured extraction layer to generate candidate planning state. When both parties have UbU, legacy transports may be upgraded by attaching, linking, or side-channeling a UbU Message Context Envelope while preserving the normal human-readable legacy message.

This metadata must be intentionally bounded. UbU should not leak private Relationship history, hidden Objectives, private Association assumptions, or sensitive Compartment contents simply because the receiver would benefit from richer context.


### 2.13 Realtime and agentic AI boundary

Realtime multimodal LLMs are optional interaction backends. They may listen, speak, watch, transcribe, translate, detect interruptions, monitor Task progress, assist meeting capture, or generate candidate UI, but they do not become UbU's authoritative planner.

UbU distinguishes **model-time awareness** from **planner-time semantics**. A model may notice elapsed time, silence, overlapping speech, or changed conditions; UbU decides whether those observations update a Task, Log, Snapshot, Calendar, Objective, or recalculation trigger.

Realtime/discovery functionality must be mode-bound and visible. The user should know whether UbU is off, text-only, in a voice session, in active Discovery mode, in meeting/logging mode, local-only, or cloud-assisted.

### 2.14 LLMs, structured outputs, and memory

LLMs are replaceable cognitive backends. They may interpret, summarize, propose, critique, classify, transcribe, generate fixtures, or call tools, but accepted state remains typed, scoped, provenance-bearing, and correctable.

Structured output is not sufficient for state admission. A schema-valid object is still a candidate until UbU validates semantics, Compartment policy, provenance, conflicts, and user-review requirements.

UbU memory should be explicit objects such as Preferences, Objectives, Identities, Associations, PlanningConstraints, TaskPatterns, AffectPatterns, Snapshots, Logs, External References, and Attestations. Vague assistant memory does not replace the UbU data model.

### 2.15 MCP-style integration boundary

UbU should be both an MCP-style client and an MCP-style server.

As a client, UbU may connect to tools, local services, repositories, calendars, email, files, model providers, and agent services. As a server, UbU may expose narrow capabilities such as candidate Task creation, Plan-summary reading, Log-candidate submission, clarification requests, Plan-repair proposals, Objective-status queries, and AssociationAttestation candidates.

Every tool surface is bounded by Identity, Compartment, capability grant, Objective scope, operation kind, time window, provenance, and review policy. External agents should usually submit candidates rather than mutate canonical state directly.

### 2.16 Delegation Substrate

The **Delegation Substrate** is the near-term model for preparing Tasks for delegation. It formalizes purpose, executor, authority, expected output, evidence, privacy scope, constraints, review, and failure/escalation path.

Delegation Substrate is useful even when the user performs a Task solo. A self-performed Task can still benefit from a clear statement of why the Task matters, what authority or context applies, what output is expected, and what evidence would prove completion.

The full Skill Barter marketplace is not an MVP requirement. MVP-relevant work should implement the primitives that make future delegation and marketplace features possible without operating a public marketplace.

### 2.17 General Contractor and Skill Barter direction

A **General Contractor** is an Identity, Agent, or Association delegated authority to coordinate multiple subordinate executors toward an Objective or Container of Tasks. The role is a first-class coordination specialization, not merely another worker label.

The **Skill Barter marketplace** is a future marketplace direction and EthConf outreach hook, especially for cypherpunk/privacy-oriented audiences. It signals voluntary coordination, sovereign identity, privacy, open markets, FOSS contribution, pseudonymous capability, and lawful user-controlled settlement references.

Skill Barter should connect to future Ethereum-aligned privacy technologies such as FHE, ZK, secure compute, private reputation, and selective disclosure while avoiding token-first, speculation-first, illicit-market, or exploitative labor framing.

### 2.18 Context assembly and background agency

Context assembly is a privacy-relevant act. UbU should track why a context bundle was assembled, which objects and Compartments it included, which Identities or Associations it exposed, where it was routed, how it was minimized, and which downstream candidate updates it supported.

Computer-use agents and background processes are high-risk actors because they may operate credentials, browsers, files, APIs, money, privacy budgets, and external systems. They require authority scopes, audit trails, prompt-injection exposure tracking, rollback or mitigation paths, and explicit notification/escalation policy.

The long-term UX should evolve into a **state-transition cockpit** rather than chat plus calendar. The Phase 1 one-next-Task loop remains the narrow proof; later UIs should help the user inspect and approve state transitions such as Plan repairs, Log corrections, Delegation Substrate packets, agent actions, AssociationAttestations, and external projections.

---

## 3. Model-committee dogfooding

UbU may use model-committee automation to help maintain its own design process.

The model committee is not the canonical decision engine. It is an advisory Automation Worker pattern that can:

- read the canonical design repo,
- identify unresolved questions,
- propose answers,
- critique alternatives,
- generate candidate changesets,
- run consistency checks,
- estimate MVP readiness,
- rank remaining open questions,
- identify follow-up questions.

Accepted design state exists only when committed to the canonical design repo.

Question rankings are derived planning metadata. They may guide the next committee run, but they are not canonical design truth.

Model-committee automation has three expected lifecycle modes:

1. **Pre-MVP:** design-freeze assistant.
2. **MVP dogfooding:** repo-maintenance and planning worker.
3. **Post-MVP:** continuous design-governance assistant.

The goal is to accelerate implementation, not to create unlimited pre-implementation design work.

Model-committee automation must be bounded by a stop rule. It should recommend further design work only when that work has greater expected value than beginning or continuing implementation.

The first implementation of this process is intentionally constrained by the v0.1 restrictions recorded in `DECISIONS.md`. The accepted v0.2 direction expands the bootstrap loop with Claude Code CLI, frontier cross-scoring, disagreement flags, schema-native structured output, and operator-run artifact publication while preserving the advisory authority boundary.

### 3.0 Current dogfooding status

`model-committee v0.1` is the first runnable bootstrap artifact for UbU’s dogfooding process.

It is not the full UbU planner, but it exercises the recursive project-governance loop: parse canonical state, check consistency, select answerable work, generate candidate changesets, score them, validate patches, and produce reviewable artifacts.

This establishes active pre-MVP dogfooding while preserving the rule that accepted design state exists only when committed to the canonical design repository.

The current strategic emphasis is to use visible dogfooding, contributor recruitment, and prototype-funder discovery to accelerate the trunk of UbU rather than to expand design philosophy indefinitely.

### 3.1 v0.1 Codex-first provider model

`model-committee` v0.1 uses Codex CLI as the primary model provider.

The runtime calls `codex exec` for:

- primary work proposal generation;
- work scoring.

Codex outputs are schema-constrained. Prompts are passed through stdin. Final responses are written to JSON files. JSONL event streams and stderr output are preserved in run logs.

Codex is used only as a proposal and scoring provider in v0.1. It must not directly mutate canonical repo files. It produces JSON work proposals and score results. Patches are validated and selected by `model-committee`, then written as review artifacts.

Every runtime Codex call must pass `--skip-git-repo-check`.

`model-committee` does not pass deprecated `--disable web_search` flags. If Codex web search must be disabled, that is handled through Codex configuration or profile state outside `model-committee`.

Local Ollama models remain secondary work proposal providers. They provide local diversity, dissent, fallback, and offline review, but Codex is the required scoring provider for automatic patch selection in v0.1.

### 3.1.1 v0.2 Claude Code and cross-scoring provider model

`model-committee v0.2` adds Claude Code CLI as a second frontier provider for both work proposal generation and scoring.

The v0.2 provider model is not raw majority voting. It is cross-scored adversarial review:

- Codex may generate work proposals.
- Claude Code may generate work proposals.
- Claude Code scores Codex-authored proposals.
- Codex scores Claude-authored proposals.
- A provider's self-score may be preserved as diagnostic metadata, but it does not count as quorum evidence.

Claude Code should use schema-native structured output through `--json-schema`. The v0.2 target environment uses Claude Code CLI `2.1.146`, which supports that flag. Claude output parsing should therefore read the schema-conforming `structured_output` field from the CLI JSON envelope when `--output-format json` and `--json-schema` are used. Prompt-only JSON extraction is a compatibility fallback, not the primary path.

Claude Code is invoked as a subprocess provider. `model-committee` itself still must not call Anthropic APIs directly. The explicit boundary is that approved provider CLIs may perform their own network/API calls according to their configured upstream authentication and billing, while `model-committee` owns orchestration, prompts, schemas, validation, manifests, logs, and review artifacts.

Claude tool authority should be restricted explicitly. The default scripted schema-output call should use no tools, or `--tools Read` only when file inspection is required. `--allowedTools` alone is not a sandbox boundary because it controls permission prompts, not the total available tool set.

v0.2 manifests and reviews should include a score matrix with author provider, scorer provider, proposal ID, score, validity, rationale, risks, and required fixes. Disagreement is signal: a large score gap between Codex and Claude Code should not be hidden inside a single aggregate score.

v0.2 automated selection requires at least one valid work proposal, at least one valid cross-score from a different frontier provider, no hard validation failure on the selected patch, and no critical disagreement flag unless manually overridden outside automatic selection. Default thresholds are a frontier score gap of 25 or more points, selected score below 70, selected patch validation failure, or no valid frontier cross-score. A dedicated human-review-required exit code, provisionally `9`, should distinguish quorum/disagreement review from invalid selected patch failure.

`review.md` should include an operator-run final step for publishing a run directory to the sibling `../model-committee-artifacts` repository. `model-committee v0.2` should generate these commands but must not auto-push or mutate remote GitHub state.

### 3.2 Changeset-based work phase

Model-committee automation should make implementation explicit.

After a selected question or problem is chosen, models may be asked to produce concrete changesets. A changeset may be a documentation patch, code patch, schema patch, or other explicit repo-state transition artifact.

Other models, or a designated scoring model, then score those changesets. The best changeset is selected and written as reviewable artifacts such as:

- `selected.patch`
- `commit_message.txt`
- `review.md`
- run logs

This prevents implementation from being hidden inside an external editor agent and makes the committee loop applicable to documentation changes, code changes, bug fixes, and future UbU implementation work.

VS Code or another editor may still be used for human review, but it is not part of the canonical committee loop.

### 3.3 Prioritized recursive loop

Model-committee automation is expected to evolve into a prioritized recursive loop:

1. **System-wide consistency check** verifies that the current project state is coherent.
2. **Question/problem prioritization selection** chooses the next work item only after consistency is known.
3. **Work** produces and scores concrete changesets.

Consistency has the highest priority because an inconsistent project state invalidates future planning.

Prioritization is second because it selects the next intended state transition.

Work is third because it should implement only a selected and justified transition.

This structure is intended to make `model-committee` an early dogfooding example of UbU coordinating its own development.

### 3.4 Consistency requirements

System-wide consistency checks should include both document consistency and logical consistency.

For `model-committee`, consistency checking should verify at least:

- canonical files exist and are parseable;
- question IDs are unique;
- decision IDs are unique;
- question dependencies point to existing questions;
- question dependencies do not contain cycles;
- `Resolved by` fields point to existing decisions or are explicitly unresolved;
- solved, decomposed, deferred, or superseded questions are marked consistently;
- question metadata satisfies the declared schema;
- derived documents do not contradict canonical files when derived-document checks are enabled.

A question should not be selected for ordinary answer/work execution if it has unresolved dependencies, unless those dependencies are answered in the same work item.

Blocked questions may still be selected for decomposition work when decomposition can produce replacement questions with fewer, simpler, or no dependencies.

### 3.5 Direct project directives

The UbU project may receive direct project-owner directives that are appended to `DECISIONS.md` as accepted decisions.

These directive decisions are treated as canonical once committed.

Directive decisions are a “word of God” mechanism for project governance, but they are still represented as explicit repo state rather than hidden chat context.

If a directive decision creates inconsistency, the next system-wide consistency check should detect it and convert the inconsistency into a problem report, question update, or work item.

### 3.6 Decomposition and design-burden reduction

Model-committee should not treat every increase in open-question count as failure.

A hard, ambiguous, or blocked question may be validly split into multiple simpler questions when the replacement questions are clearer, narrower, lower-risk, or easier to automatically answer.

This is especially valuable when a blocked question can be decomposed into replacement questions where at least one replacement question has fewer dependencies, simpler dependencies, or no dependencies.

The relevant metric is unresolved design burden, not merely raw open-question count.

A decomposition is bad when it creates more, harder, vaguer, or more coupled questions.

A decomposition is good when it exposes smaller answerable units and improves future automation.

### 3.7 Answerability-first prioritization

Question selection should use answerability as the first gate.

A question is eligible for ordinary work only if:

- it has no dependencies;
- all dependencies are solved;
- or all dependencies are being answered in the same work item.

After answerability is established, questions are ranked by:

1. automation-likelihood,
2. importance,
3. risk ascending.

Questions blocked by unresolved dependencies may be selected for decomposition rather than ordinary answering.

### 3.8 v0.1 and v0.2 provider and network boundaries

`model-committee` v0.1 is a narrow local Python CLI.

It may communicate only with:

- local Ollama `base_url`;
- Codex CLI subprocesses.

v0.2 may also invoke Claude Code CLI as an explicitly configured subprocess provider.

`model-committee` itself must not call:

- GitHub;
- OpenAI APIs directly;
- Anthropic APIs directly;
- Gemini APIs;
- arbitrary HTTP URLs.

`httpx` may be used only for the configured Ollama `base_url`. Frontier cloud providers are accessed through approved CLI subprocess boundaries rather than direct API calls by `model-committee`.

This provider policy preserves the bootstrap architecture and prevents accidental API creep while allowing approved CLI providers to use their own upstream authentication and billing.

### 3.9 v0.1 and v0.2 testing and diagnostics

`model-committee` v0.1 should include fake provider mode for deterministic tests.

Fake provider mode should not call Codex or Ollama. It should load canned fixture responses, then run normal JSON validation, patch validation, scoring, selection, and artifact-writing logic.

`model-committee` v0.1 should also include a `doctor` command that checks the local environment:

- Python version;
- `git` availability;
- `codex` availability;
- required `codex exec` flags;
- Claude Code CLI availability when enabled;
- Claude Code schema-native structured-output support when enabled;
- Ollama reachability;
- configured Ollama model availability;
- required target repo files;
- runs directory writability.

A `version` command should print the installed `model-committee` version.

### 3.10 v0.1 and v0.2 authority boundary

`model-committee` has advisory authority only in both v0.1 and v0.2. It may produce derived analysis and review artifacts, but it must not directly create accepted design state. Accepted design state exists only after an ordinary human-reviewed repo change is committed to the canonical repo.

The following actions may be automated in v0.1:

- read `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`;
- parse open questions and their metadata;
- run consistency checks over canonical files;
- rank answerable questions using answerability, automation-likelihood, importance, and risk;
- generate schema-constrained Codex work proposals and score results;
- collect Ollama work proposals as secondary proposal inputs;
- validate proposal JSON and candidate patches mechanically;
- select a patch only from mechanically valid proposals using a valid Codex score result;
- write run logs, review artifacts, selected patches, and commit-message suggestions.

v0.2 additionally may automate:

- invoking Claude Code CLI as a schema-native subprocess provider;
- generating and validating Claude Code work proposals and score results;
- cross-scoring Codex and Claude Code proposals;
- constructing score-matrix artifacts;
- detecting disagreement and quorum failures;
- writing human-review-required results when quorum, score, or disagreement thresholds fail;
- adding operator-run artifact-publication commands to `review.md`.

The following actions require human repository review in v0.1 and v0.2:

- accepting a proposed answer as design state;
- applying, editing, or committing any candidate patch to canonical files;
- changing question status, priority, dependencies, or resolved-by metadata in the canonical repo;
- treating readiness estimates as release, scope-freeze, or go/no-go decisions;
- converting a proposed open question into canonical `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` state;
- changing provider weights, quorum rules, or network/provider boundaries.

The following actions are outside automatic authority:

- direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, GitHub, or arbitrary HTTP API calls by `model-committee` itself;
- auto-merge, auto-push, automatic PR creation, or GitHub mutation;
- automatic artifact publication;
- automatic patch application to canonical repo files;
- allowing Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI, Ollama, or any model provider to directly edit canonical repo files;
- internal manual override of failed scoring, quorum, disagreement, or patch-selection checks;
- readiness-score writes to derived public files such as `README.md`;
- deriving canonical user value, project directives, or release commitments from model output alone.

Provider outputs are weighted by configured trust weights, provider role, cross-score status, and observed reliability metadata, not by one-provider-one-vote counting. Static configured weights are sufficient for v0.1 and v0.2; adaptive weighting remains deferred.

Provider failures are logged as run events. A failure should record the provider, model, run phase, failure class, timeout or exit status when available, stderr/response artifact path when available, and whether quorum remained satisfied.

A valid v0.1 committee result requires at least one mechanically valid work proposal and a valid Codex score result. Two or more valid proposals are preferred but not required. Failed secondary providers do not invalidate a run when quorum is met.

A valid automated v0.2 committee result requires at least one valid work proposal, at least one valid cross-score from a different frontier provider, no hard validation failure on the selected patch, and no critical disagreement flag unless manually overridden outside automatic selection. Human-review-required results should use a distinct exit code, provisionally `9`.

Codex CLI and Claude Code CLI authority differ from direct API authority because they are invoked only as subprocess providers. Their outputs are proposal and scoring artifacts only. Direct OpenAI and Anthropic API authority is zero because direct cloud-provider API calls by `model-committee` are forbidden.

## 4. MVP Release Phases

### 4.1 Phase 1: Single-user GitHub dogfooding

A single user uses UbU to coordinate development of UbU itself.

Primary goals:

- import or observe GitHub issues, PRs, reviews, CI events, and milestones;
- represent them in UbU’s Objective/Task/Calendar model;
- generate useful Plans;
- provide a minimal bootstrap interview that creates an initial dogfooding context, current or stale affect Snapshot, and prioritized Objective/Task seed set;
- provide a next-action focus mode that shows one recommended next Task with an inspectable explanation of why it matters now;
- update GitHub as a low-dimensional projection of UbU state;
- expose limitations and open questions through dogfooding.

The frozen Phase 1 implementation set is:

- local single-user `user_mode` instance for UbU-runs-UbU;
- bootstrap interview and explicit seed model creation;
- GitHub issue, PR, review, CI, milestone, and comment import from live data or approved fixtures;
- ExternalReference-style source links sufficient to trace imported GitHub objects;
- Objective, Preference, Task, Container, UniverseState, Snapshot, Plan, Calendar, Log, Identity, Relationship, Compartment, Automation Worker, External Event, and External Reference schemas only to the depth required by the dogfooding loop;
- schedulable Static and Dynamic Tasks with Objective links, durations, dependency/precondition/effect fields, active/completed/failed/moot lifecycle handling, and moot reason codes sufficient for the demo;
- lightweight UniverseState facts, affect Snapshot handling, accepted mutation vocabulary, and deterministic precondition evaluation;
- append-only per-instance Logs with correction, annotation, provenance, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries;
- Plan and Calendar generation for a next work window with a default Plan and inspectable explanation;
- next-action focus mode with start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, explain-more, and feedback controls;
- derived risk and human-complete plan-quality reports covering deadline risk, dependency fragility, worker or automation bottlenecks, stale affect, affect-margin, destructive pressure, and post-plan depletion warnings;
- minimal Compartment guardrails for `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed integration/device references, low-security labeling, and logged boundary decisions;
- Automation Worker identity, scoped capability grants, explicit assignment/status display, and mutation or projection request submission without direct canonical writes;
- Delegation Substrate-compatible Task formalization fields where needed for dogfooding, worker assignment, or solo self-reminder clarity, including purpose, executor type, authority, expected output, evidence, review, privacy scope, and escalation notes;
- clearly marked GitHub projection previews or human-approved writes for UbU-managed labels, comments, or blocks, plus reconciliation reporting;
- manually structured Release Outreach Pipeline work items and artifact records for release notes, screenshots, scripts, and contributor calls-to-action;
- manually structured EthConf outreach notes and follow-up artifacts that dogfood Association formation and organizational introspection without requiring full multi-user Association automation.

Phase 2 explicitly defers:

- multi-device local-first sync;
- partial replication across Devices, Zones, or Compartments;
- secure cross-device Compartment propagation;
- sync conflict handling;
- cross-device worker or enclave coordination beyond the single local instance boundary.

Phase 3 explicitly includes:

- minimal cross-user contextual messaging between UbU instances;
- user-to-user Identity-mediated requests, status updates, questions, commitments, and blockers;
- bounded Message Context Envelopes carrying priority, interrupt recommendation, topic, response expectation, assumptions, ambiguities, provenance, and disclosure policy;
- legacy-message ingestion and limited upgrade paths where both parties use UbU;
- user-to-user Identity commitments, capabilities, and limited disclosure sufficient for narrow coordination;
- early Delegation Substrate use between Identities, if Phase 2/3 authority and privacy boundaries are in place.

Phase 3 still defers:

- shared global project truth between users;
- rich subjective Relationship-model exchange;
- full Association synchronization;
- multi-party governance, invitation, revocation, or trust protocols;
- broad personal-data ingestion beyond selected communication integrations.

Phase 1 keeps these abstractions documented for compatibility but does not implement them:

- Technique as a first-class planning object;
- full Compact Calendar planner grammar and high-coverage transport format;
- complete Zone and Device system beyond the current local execution enclave;
- organization-mode and worker-mode web admin consoles;
- richer relationship-management, personal CRM, and longitudinal affect/growth models;
- full Release Outreach Pipeline video generation, rendering, and publication workflow;
- broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion outside narrow approved dogfooding fixtures;
- full realtime multimodal capture, always-on assistant behavior, public Skill Barter marketplace operation, payment/settlement flows, reputation markets, dispute resolution, and General Contractor subdelegation workflows;
- adaptive model-committee weighting, automatic patch application, GitHub mutation, and direct cloud-provider APIs.

Stop rule:

> A new abstraction may be added to Phase 1 only when it is required to complete the single-user GitHub dogfooding loop, enforce an accepted hard invariant, or avoid a known irreversible schema contradiction. Otherwise it must be documented as a Phase 2, Phase 3, or post-MVP concern and must not block Phase 1 implementation.

The minimum dogfooding loop that proves UbU’s core model is:

1. bootstrap the operator, project context, available work window, constraints, and current or stale affect Snapshot;
2. import or load a curated UbU GitHub fixture with issues, PR/review/CI signals, milestone context, and source links;
3. map those inputs into Objectives, Tasks, External Events, Logs, UniverseState facts, and External References;
4. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
5. present one recommended next Task with an explanation of Objective value, dependencies, deadlines, affect constraints, worker status, and risk findings;
6. record completion, failure, snooze, rejection, decomposition, or override as Log evidence and trigger recalculation when appropriate;
7. preview or perform a human-approved UbU-managed GitHub projection update;
8. show a reconciliation or risk summary that makes the changed model inspectable.

### 4.1.1 Phase 1 public demo criteria

The Phase 1 public demo should use real UbU GitHub issues or a frozen fixture captured from real UbU GitHub data when live access is unsafe, unavailable, or non-reproducible.

The smallest persuasive demo is an end-to-end single-user dogfooding loop:

1. import a curated set of UbU issues, PR/review/CI signals, and milestone context;
2. map those inputs into Objectives, schedulable Tasks, External Events, and traceable source links;
3. generate a Calendar with a default Plan for the next work window;
4. show why the Plan was chosen, including dependencies and worker assignment or worker status;
5. show user-mode affect constraints by applying a current affect Snapshot or by creating an affect-collection Task when affect data is stale or missing;
6. write or preview clearly marked UbU-managed GitHub projection labels, comments, or managed blocks;
7. show a risk summary covering at least deadline risk, dependency fragility, and worker or automation bottlenecks.

The demo must not require Phase 2 sync, Phase 3 multi-user coordination, full RBAC, a complete Compact Calendar UI, or autonomous remote GitHub mutation. If live GitHub writes are unsafe for the public recording, a dry-run projection is acceptable only when it shows the exact payload that would be written after human approval.

### 4.1.2 Phase 1 user-facing loop

Phase 1 must include a minimal first-person UX loop for dogfooding. The loop is intentionally narrow: it collects explicit answers, creates explicit UbU objects, recommends one next Task, records what happened, and recalculates from Logs and current state.

1. **Bootstrap interview**
   - Ask exactly the minimum questions needed to seed the first dogfooding Plan:
     1. `What are you trying to move forward right now?`
     2. `Which project context should UbU use for this first session?`
     3. `How much usable time do you have for the next work window?`
     4. `Is there a deadline, meeting, release target, or external event that changes what matters today?`
     5. `What work should UbU consider first?`
     6. `What is already blocked, unavailable, or not worth recommending right now?`
     7. `How are your energy, stress, and mood right now?`
     8. `When choosing between useful work, what should UbU favor today?`
   - Record the project/context answer as UniverseState facts and source-linked Logs.
   - Record available time, static commitments, deadlines, and immediate constraints as UniverseState facts, Tasks, External Events, or Logs.
   - Record affect answers as a user-declared Snapshot, or create an affect-collection Task when the user skips or the data is stale.
   - Record favored tradeoffs as Preferences only when the user accepts an explicit Preference statement; otherwise retain them as Log notes or Objective annotations.
   - Seed a small Objective/Task set from user answers plus approved GitHub fixtures or configured imports.

2. **Minimum data for one recommendation**
   - A user or operator Identity.
   - At least one active Objective.
   - At least one active schedulable Task linked to that Objective with title and duration or work-window estimate.
   - A current work window or next available time.
   - Current or explicitly stale affect state.
   - Known hard blockers, deadlines, dependencies, and source references for the recommended Task when available.
   - If this minimum is missing, the next recommended Task should be a clarification, import, or affect-collection Task rather than pretending to optimize.

3. **Plan generation**
   - Generate a candidate default Plan from explicit modeled state.
   - Preserve inspectability of the full Plan.
   - Explain relevant Objective value, constraints, dependencies, deadlines, risk findings, worker status, and affect constraints.
   - Mark any fixture-backed, hardcoded, or mock recommendation path directly in the UI and run artifact.

4. **Calendar preview**
   - Treat Calendar preview as a notable Task that should run regularly.
   - Let the user inspect the candidate Calendar or default Plan before relying on it.
   - Ask whether the Plan feels plausible, motivating, humane, and consistent with the user's current context.
   - Allow the user to correct Preferences, Objectives, Tasks, affect Snapshots, availability, or estimates before execution.

5. **Next-action focus mode**
   - Present one recommended next Task as the default UI surface.
   - Show title, Objective link, estimated duration or work window, current status, and source/provenance label.
   - Show `why this matters now` with at least the served Objective, timing reason, main dependency or blocker status, affect/staleness status, and top risk or opportunity considered.
   - Show what UbU considered, including visible counts or links for candidate Tasks, blocked Tasks, hard constraints, affect constraints, worker/projection state, and imported or fixture sources.
   - Provide controls for start, done, snooze, reject, decompose, override, and explain more.
   - Keep full Plan inspection one action away through a Plan drawer, timeline, or inspector that shows ordered Tasks, assumptions, source links, and explanation fragments.
   - One-task focus reduces cognitive load; it must not hide the Plan, turn the recommendation into opaque automation, or imply that the user has committed to the default Plan.

6. **Feedback, Log review, and recalculation**
   - After `done`, ask whether completion matched the estimate, whether the modeled effect happened, and whether energy or stress changed enough to update the Snapshot.
   - After failure or blocked execution, ask what assumption failed: missing dependency, wrong duration, stale affect, interruption, unclear Task, changed priority, or other.
   - After snooze, ask for the next review time or condition and whether the reason is timing, affect, dependency, or user preference.
   - After rejection, ask whether the Task is wrong, not valuable now, blocked, too large, already done, duplicate, or should become moot.
   - After override, record the chosen Task or action, the reason if supplied, and whether the override should update Preferences, availability, Task estimates, Objective status, or only this Plan.
   - Record outcomes as Logs and trigger recalculation when the outcome changes Task status, availability, affect state, dependencies, Objective status, or user Preferences.
   - Treat failure, rejection, override, and deviation as model evidence, not user blame.

7. **Discovery mode when appropriate**
   - Allow the user to choose discovery mode at any time.
   - Use discovery mode to collect or preserve evidence about what the user is doing or did, especially from mobile sensors or configured integrations.
   - Defer ambiguous interpretation until later Log review or user-visible reconciliation.

The Phase 1 version may be simple and fixture-backed. Fixture behavior must be labeled as fixture behavior, mock recommendations must not be described as implemented planning, and public demos should show the exact boundary between explicit UbU objects, approved fixtures, and implemented planner behavior. The public demonstration pattern is bootstrap, one recommended next Task, explanation, user feedback, recalculation, and full-Plan inspection. It does not require broad email, text-message, file, invoice, note, or personal-data ingestion. It must not claim complete life-modeling, therapeutic authority, autonomous life coaching, complete planning automation, full privacy isolation, Phase 2 sync, or Phase 3 multi-user coordination. The purpose is to demonstrate the core UbU experience: one meaningful next action, with an explanation, grounded in explicit state.

### 4.1.3 Release Outreach Pipeline dogfooding

The Release Outreach Pipeline should become part of ordinary UbU-runs-UbU release management. A minor release should produce a release outreach package when the current project state contains enough user-visible, developer-visible, or contributor-visible change to justify public explanation.

A release outreach package may include:

- a public release-note summary;
- a developer release-note summary;
- a short user-facing video script;
- a developer-facing video segment or call-to-action;
- screenshot and screen-recording references from automated UI runs, fixtures, or explicitly approved mock data;
- captions or narration text;
- YouTube title, description, and chapter outline;
- social or mailing-list announcement drafts;
- known limitations and future-work notes;
- a contributor next-action list tied to real issues or artifacts.

The package should record provenance. Each claim should identify whether it came from an implemented feature, accepted design decision, closed issue, test fixture, UI capture, release note, or future-plan label. Public artifacts should not represent planned or mock behavior as implemented behavior.

The Phase 1 minimum may be manual but structured: the project operator can write or approve the release notes, screenshots, and script while UbU records the artifact set as a WorkItem sequence. Later phases should automate screenshot capture from UI tests, demo-flow export, script drafting, voice/narration preparation, caption generation, video-render-plan generation, publication metadata, and review gates.

The full video-generation pipeline is future work. Phase 1 should preserve the model boundary: generate reviewable communication artifacts before trying to automate external publication.


### 4.1.4 EthConf outreach as Association-introspection dogfooding

EthConf outreach is a Phase 1 dogfooding workflow for Association formation and organizational introspection.

The UbU project should treat outreach as an attempt to form an ad hoc Association around the project: contributors, reviewers, funders, workflow informants, privacy/cypherpunk contacts, and possible design partners. Conversation notes, follow-up commitments, public artifacts, private/redacted observations, and missed follow-ups can become evidence for whether the project actually pursued its stated goals.

For Phase 1, this does not require full multi-user Association implementation. It can be represented through structured outreach Objectives, Tasks, Logs, External Events, External References, and reviewable candidate AssociationAttestations generated manually or by local/allowed LLM review.

The dogfooding question is: can UbU produce an evidence-backed retrospective showing whether UbU actually formed useful coordination around its own project?

### 4.1.5 Optional VoxPopuli EthConf demo

UbU may optionally demonstrate a **VoxPopuli** flow at EthConf if it does not displace higher-priority dogfooding, contributor, or funder deliverables. In this flow, a user speaks freely about what they wish would happen or what feels disorganized. An LLM-assisted extractor converts that natural-language input into candidate Objectives, Tasks, constraints, preferences, and planning assumptions for the user to inspect, correct, accept, or reject.

VoxPopuli is a trust-building outreach hook, not a replacement for the narrow Phase 1 bootstrap interview. It should demonstrate how LLMs can help structure abstract human concerns while UbU remains the explicit, inspectable planning system.

### 4.2 Phase 2: Single-user multi-device synchronization

A single user runs UbU across multiple Devices / execution enclaves.

Phase 2 validates:

- local-first sync;
- partial replication;
- Zone and Compartment boundaries;
- device roles;
- conflict handling;
- user-owned worker execution on the user's laptop, desktop, or other trusted personal compute device.

Design rubric:

> Phase 2 should feel like multi-agent coordination, but all agents happen to agree.

A Phase 2 personal worker is not a mandatory cloud dependency. It is an optional execution backend for a user's own UbU instance. It may provide more CPU, GPU, memory, storage, network availability, or battery-independent runtime than the mobile device while preserving the user's practical control over the compute environment.

### 4.3 Phase 3: Minimal multi-user / Identity coordination

Multiple humans coordinate through explicit Identities, capabilities, limited disclosure, and commitments.

Phase 3 should enable coordination without surveillance or shared global truth.

---

## 5. Operating Modes

Each UbU instance runs in exactly one mode. Modes are mutually exclusive and cannot change after initialization.

### 5.1 `user_mode`

A personal UbU instance operated for an autonomous human user.

Properties:

- includes user affect modeling;
- represents personal Objectives and Preferences;
- may integrate with personal calendars, tasks, messages, sensors, and devices;
- supports personal Zones and Compartments.

### 5.2 `organization_mode`

An organizational UbU instance operated on behalf of a project or organization.

Important philosophical note:

An organization is not an autonomous human. Organization mode is shorthand for a human-operated planning system where the organization appears as a structure in UniverseState, directives, Identities, and Preferences.

Properties:

- does not model intrinsic affect;
- may use Preferences as organizational directives;
- may be run on a thin web/database host;
- may delegate work to Automation Workers;
- may expose a web UI;
- may eventually support classic user accounts and access control.

For MVP, all organization-mode users may be treated as admin-equivalent to avoid premature RBAC complexity.

### 5.3 `worker_mode`

A worker-mode instance performs delegated work assigned by another UbU instance.

A worker-mode instance is usually:

- one-device / one-enclave;
- daemon/service-oriented;
- administered through a web page and/or CLI;
- capable of running heavy compute or GPU workloads;
- externally represented as an Identity;
- assigned Tasks by a user-mode or organization-mode instance.

Worker mode may run on a local machine, a server, or a thin controller that starts/stops cloud compute resources.

Some entities are implemented in MVP. Others are documented now to avoid future contradiction.

---

## 7. Objectives

An **Objective** is a desired or maintained state of the universe.

Examples:

- “Release UbU MVP”
- “Review open pull requests”
- “Maintain relationship with contributor X”
- “Collect affect information relevant to important usage”
- “Finish documentation draft”
- “Explain the latest release to users and contributors”

Objectives are the canonical anchor for value.

### 7.1 Objective modes

An Objective has one of two modes:

- `one_time`
- `evergreen`

#### One-time Objective

A one-time Objective is completed once and does not reactivate.

#### Evergreen Objective

An evergreen Objective may become satisfied and later become active again.

Example:

- “Maintain clean kitchen”
- “Keep relationship with X warm”
- “Collect affect information”
- “Manage GitHub issue queue”

### 7.2 MVP Objective fields

Required:

- `objective_id`
- `title_or_description`
- `mode`
- `status`

Optional:

- `notes`
- `tags`
- `linked_container_refs`

Derived / transient:

- `derived_util_cache`
- predicted satisfaction
- observed satisfaction

Not present in MVP:

- linked Techniques
- explicit satisfaction field
- required provenance

### 7.3 Objective statuses

Candidate MVP statuses:

- `active`
- `satisfied`
- `completed`
- `abandoned`
- `invalid`
- `superseded`

Mode rules:

- `completed` applies to one-time Objectives.
- `satisfied` applies to evergreen Objectives.
- `satisfied` is not a valid one-time Objective status.
- `completed` is not a valid evergreen Objective status.

One-time Objective transitions:

- `active` may transition to `completed`, `abandoned`, `invalid`, or `superseded`.
- `completed`, `abandoned`, and `superseded` are terminal for normal planning.
- `invalid` may be applied from any one-time Objective status when the Objective is discovered to be malformed, impossible, contradictory, or admitted by mistake.
- `superseded` may be applied from any one-time Objective status except `invalid` when a newer Objective or accepted design/source artifact replaces the Objective.
- One-time Objectives do not reactivate after `completed`; later renewed intent should use a new Objective or explicit supersession.

Evergreen Objective transitions:

- `active` may transition to `satisfied`, `abandoned`, `invalid`, or `superseded`.
- `satisfied` may transition to `active`, `abandoned`, `invalid`, or `superseded`.
- `abandoned` and `superseded` are terminal for normal planning.
- `invalid` may be applied from any evergreen Objective status when the Objective is discovered to be malformed, impossible, contradictory, or admitted by mistake.
- `superseded` may be applied from any evergreen Objective status except `invalid` when a newer Objective or accepted design/source artifact replaces the Objective.

Evergreen `satisfied` to `active` reactivation is a canonical transition only when the current accepted state changes through user declaration, authorized observation/import, or elapsed-time recurrence evaluation. Hypothetical Plan simulation may predict future reactivation, but does not by itself mutate canonical Objective status.

Every accepted canonical Objective status transition creates an `objective_transitioned` Log entry. Simulated or predicted status changes inside candidate Plans are not canonical transitions and do not create Objective transition Logs unless accepted as real state.

### 7.4 Evergreen recurrence

Evergreen Objectives may include recurrence/reactivation behavior.

For MVP:

- default recurrence type: `maintenance_time_decay`
- recurrence may be represented as a static timespan or simple PDF-like field
- user declarations or authorized observations may modify satisfaction state

---

## 8. Preferences and Value

A **Preference** is a relation between Objectives.

Value is derived from Preferences, not directly authored as an absolute scalar.

### 8.1 Preference object

MVP fields:

- `objective_a`
- `objective_b`
- `order`
- `acquired_method`
- `acquired_date`
- `enabled`

`order` may be:

- `a_preferred_to_b`
- `a_indifferent_to_b`

`acquired_method` may include:

- `user_defined`
- `llm_estimated`

More detailed method metadata may be added later.

### 8.2 Ordinal rankings

Ordinal UI input compiles immediately into pairwise Preference objects.

The original ordinal ranking may be retained in the log, but Preferences remain pairwise in the canonical model.

### 8.3 Indifference

Indifference is explicit.

Indifferent Objectives are assigned equal derived util values.

### 8.4 Preference contradictions

Preference cycles are logistical consistency errors.

Example:

- `A > B`
- `B > C`
- `C > A`

UbU must query the user for resolution with high priority.

### 8.5 Derived utils

Derived util values are transient and may be cached on Objectives.

They must be treated as volatile and recalculated when needed.

Default MVP direction:

- active Preferences form a DAG of Objectives;
- indifference creates equal-util levels;
- least-preferred level receives util `1.0`;
- each higher level is multiplied by `√2`.

Util derivation is typically local to the Objective subset being compared in a single planning process.

### 8.6 Preference calibration examples

A **PreferenceCalibrationExample** is a user-facing prompt or scenario used to help the user make better Preference judgments. It may describe a common emotional cost, common emotional reward, motivation ambiguity, social-pressure pattern, or tradeoff.

Preference calibration examples are MVP-important onboarding and review aids. They are not canonical value objects unless the user accepts or edits the resulting judgment into a Preference or other canonical entry.

Candidate fields for a calibration example include:

- `example_id`
- `situation_summary`
- `common_emotional_costs`
- `common_emotional_rewards`
- `possible_tradeoffs`
- `calibration_question`
- `resulting_object_refs`
- `source`

Open details are tracked in `UBU-Q0051`.

---

## 9. WorkItems, Tasks, and Containers

### 9.1 WorkItem

A **WorkItem** is the abstraction over concrete work-like entities.

A WorkItem may be:

- Task
- Container
- possible future subtype

### 9.2 Task

A **Task** is a schedulable WorkItem.

Tasks may be:

- Static Task
- Dynamic Task

#### Static Task

A Static Task has fixed start and end times.

Examples:

- meeting
- class
- appointment

Static Tasks are included directly in Plans.

#### Dynamic Task

A Dynamic Task has flexible scheduling.

Dynamic Tasks may have:

- duration or duration PDF
- dependencies
- preconditions
- effects
- Objective link
- success probability
- affect delta
- expected cost

### 9.3 MVP Task schedulability invariant

A Task is schedulable in MVP if it has:

- stable ID
- Objective link
- duration or duration PDF
- active status
- title

Permitted:

- dependencies may be empty
- earliest-start may be absent
- due may be absent
- cost may be absent
- effect may be absent in exceptional cases

Tasks with no known modeled effect may be reportable as low-utility or “meaningless” for plan scoring.

### 9.4 Container

A **Container** groups WorkItems.

Containers are not directly scheduled in Plans. Plans contain Tasks.

A Container may represent:

- decomposed work
- preempted work
- Technique instantiation
- grouped child Tasks
- Super Automation workflow structure

Container completion is derived from child states.

A Container is complete when all child Tasks are either:

- completed
- moot

Task-to-Container mutation is a structural replacement, not an in-place type change. The original Task handle remains a historical Task handle and is not reused as the Container handle.

Mutation creates a new Container with a new `container_id`. The Container records `origin_task_ref`, `mutation_reason`, `mutation_log_ref`, child WorkItem refs, and lineage/provenance sufficient to trace the restructuring.

All child Tasks created by decomposition, preemption, retry, or worker expansion receive new Task handles. Existing child or continuation Tasks may be linked into the Container, but the mutation operation does not reassign the original Task handle to a child.

The original Task transitions to `moot` with reason code `replaced_by_new_plan_structure` when decomposition or regrouping preserves the underlying intent. If responsibility moves to another executor without decomposition, `delegated` may be more accurate; if a newer source artifact replaces the Task, `superseded` may be more accurate.

Fields that describe the original intent stay on the Container or its lineage metadata: title or summary, served Objective refs, parent/dependency context, external-reference lineage, Compartment/security labels, authority/provenance, and notes needed to explain why the work was split.

Fields that make a schedulable action executable belong on child Tasks: duration or duration PDF, preconditions, effects, executor/delegation fields, worker assignment/status, expected output, evidence requirements, and any child-specific dependencies or deadlines. Child Tasks may inherit or narrow Objective refs, Compartment refs, authority source, and External Reference context when valid, but they do not silently inherit stale status, completion evidence, or modeled effects that no longer apply.

External References are preserved by linking the external object to the new Container when it represents the larger work and to child Tasks only when the external object supports, evidences, or projects that specific child. The original Task's historical External References are not rewritten; new `supersedes`, `projection_of`, `supports`, or `evidence_for` references may be added according to the accepted External Reference model.

GitHub-linked Task decomposition should keep the GitHub Issue or PR traceable to the Container and add child-level External References only for actionable subwork that needs projection or reconciliation. Automation Worker child Tasks are ordinary child Tasks with worker/delegation metadata; workers may propose this restructuring only through authorized mutation requests, and the canonical instance validates and logs the applied or rejected mutation.

### 9.5 Moot

`moot` is a first-class terminal Task status.

It is functionally equivalent to completion for planning, but distinct for logs and reporting.

MVP moot reason codes are schema-controlled enum values:

- `externally_satisfied`
- `superseded`
- `delegated`
- `no_longer_relevant`
- `invalidated_by_universe_change`
- `replaced_by_new_plan_structure`
- `user_declared_moot`
- `automation_obsolete`
- `duplicate`

The MVP list is sufficient for Phase 1 and intentionally closed to free-form reason codes. New canonical reason codes require an explicit schema migration or accepted decision. Implementations may store human-readable notes on the `task_moot` Log entry, but the canonical `moot_reason_code` remains one of the enum values.

`duplicate` is included because duplicate work is common in imported GitHub/project queues and should be queryable separately from generic plan supersession.

`delegated` remains separate from `externally_satisfied`. `delegated` means the Task is no longer work for this executor because responsibility moved to another executor, worker, Identity, or delegation path. It does not by itself assert that the underlying Objective or required world state has been satisfied. `externally_satisfied` means the desired state became true through another action or event, regardless of delegation.

Use the narrowest accurate code:

- `externally_satisfied`: the required state is already true because of outside action or observation.
- `superseded`: this Task is replaced by a newer Task, Objective, decision, or source artifact.
- `delegated`: responsibility moved out of this Task's executor scope and will be tracked elsewhere.
- `no_longer_relevant`: the Task is no longer useful, but not because the world invalidated it.
- `invalidated_by_universe_change`: an external state change made the Task impossible or wrong.
- `replaced_by_new_plan_structure`: decomposition, regrouping, or planning restructure replaced this Task without changing the underlying intent.
- `user_declared_moot`: the user explicitly says the Task should be treated as moot and no more specific code is appropriate.
- `automation_obsolete`: a worker, automation path, or generated work item is obsolete because automation state changed.
- `duplicate`: the Task duplicates another active, completed, or canonical work item.

---

## 10. Task Preconditions and Effects

### 10.1 Preconditions

Preconditions are deterministic constraints over UniverseState.

If preconditions are unknown or partially modeled, they are treated as absent in MVP.

MVP preconditions use a recursive object with `all_of` and `any_of` arrays for simple AND/OR composition. A leaf predicate has `target`, `predicate`, and optional `expected` fields. `target` uses the same dotted UniverseState target convention as mutations, beginning with `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`.

MVP predicates are:

- `equals`, for exact JSON-compatible equality;
- `member_of`, for checking that `expected` is present in a `set_memberships` target;
- `absent`, for checking that a target is not present or has been cleared.

Numeric comparisons are not in MVP, even for `numeric_values` targets. Numeric values may be checked only by equality or absence.

Preconditions may reference event markers, affect-related UniverseState keys in `user_mode`, and Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys when the containing Task is allowed to see those targets. Organization-mode and worker-mode validation must reject intrinsic-affect preconditions. Relationship-relevant and Compartment-protected targets remain subject to Compartment policy, mode rules, and user-acceptance requirements for private or inferred claims.

A failed precondition means the Task is blocked for planning and execution, not invalid. `unschedulable` is a derived planner result when no placement satisfies otherwise valid preconditions and Calendar Logic; `invalid` is reserved for malformed Tasks, malformed precondition schema, forbidden targets, or contradictions in canonical state.

### 10.2 Effects

A Task effect describes predicted mutation of UniverseState if the Task succeeds.

MVP effect object:

- scalar success probability
- mutation list

If success probability is `1` or `null`, the effect is assumed to occur when the Task completes.

If a Task fails, UniverseState is unchanged in MVP.

### 10.3 Duration and success probability

Duration uncertainty and success probability are distinct.

A Task may have:

- fixed duration
- duration PDF
- scalar success probability on the effect object

Task duration PDFs likely use seconds as the canonical time unit in MVP.

## 11. UniverseState

**UniverseState** is a first-class object representing the modeled state of the world relevant to UbU planning.

For MVP, UniverseState is a lightweight shell with loosely typed facts and events.

### 11.1 MVP UniverseState fields

Core shell:

- `universe_state_id`
- `timestamp` or valid-at instant
- `facts`
- `numeric_values`
- `set_memberships`
- `event_markers`
- `source_summary`
- `confidence_summary` optional

### 11.2 UniverseState values

MVP value discipline:

- fact keys are free-form strings;
- default keys should use a lightweight namespace convention;
- values are text / JSON-like payloads.

A stricter ontology can be added later.

### 11.3 Mutation vocabulary

MVP mutations support:

- `set_fact`
- `clear_fact`
- `increment_numeric`
- `decrement_numeric`
- `add_membership`
- `remove_membership`
- `append_event_marker`

MVP mutation items use a small deterministic schema. Required fields are `operation` and `target`; `payload` is required except for `clear_fact`; `note` is optional. Mutation items do not carry item-level confidence, source, or provenance in MVP. Those belong on the containing Task effect, Snapshot, Log entry, worker mutation request, External Reference, or other envelope.

Targets are dotted strings. The first segment names the UniverseState collection being changed: `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`. Remaining segments form the lightweight namespaced key inside that collection. Example targets include `facts.github.issue.14.pipeline_state`, `numeric_values.affect.energy`, `set_memberships.github.issue.14.labels`, and `event_markers.relationship.rel_123.interactions`.

Payload rules by operation:

- `set_fact`: any JSON-compatible value;
- `clear_fact`: no payload;
- `increment_numeric` / `decrement_numeric`: numeric delta payload;
- `add_membership` / `remove_membership`: JSON scalar member payload, usually a string;
- `append_event_marker`: JSON object payload describing the lightweight marker.

A Task effect's mutation list is unconditional once that effect succeeds. Conditional behavior belongs in Task preconditions, effect success probability, or planner branching, not in individual mutation items. Implementations should validate the full mutation list before applying it and apply valid items in list order.

Mutation targets may include affect-related UniverseState keys in `user_mode`; organization and worker modes must reject intrinsic-affect mutations. Mutation targets may include Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys, but inferred or worker-generated relationship facts remain subject to Compartment policy, mode rules, provenance/logging envelopes, and user acceptance where required. Task effects should not silently overwrite user-declared private affect or Relationship truths.

---

## 12. Snapshots

A **Snapshot** is an observed state update.

User-declared and sensor-derived observations use the same object type.

Snapshots are partial observed assertions over specific UniverseState fields. They are not full-state replacements and do not assert anything about omitted fields.

MVP snapshot fields:

- `snapshot_id`
- `timestamp` or valid-at instant
- `source`
- per-dimension or per-field values
- snapshot-level confidence
- optional per-field confidence overrides
- correction or revocation status derived from Log correction links

### 12.1 Snapshot precedence rule

- Latest observed snapshot overrides simulation on conflicting fields.
- User-declared snapshots are top-priority observations.
- Confidence is stored, but does not override explicit user declaration in MVP.
- Between conflicting user-declared Snapshots for the same field, latest effective timestamp wins unless a later Log correction says otherwise.
- Between conflicting non-user observations, source priority, effective timestamp, and confidence may be used by the Snapshot application algorithm.

Snapshot records are immutable once accepted into the append-only Log. A Snapshot may be corrected or revoked only by a later Log correction entry that points to the original Snapshot observation. A correction that asserts replacement state creates a new Snapshot and links it to the corrected Snapshot or Log entry; a revocation without replacement simply removes the original Snapshot from corrected query views while preserving the historical claim.

### 12.2 Discovery mode

**Discovery mode** is a user-selectable workflow state, not a fourth instance operating mode. A user may choose discovery mode at any time to let UbU gather or preserve evidence about actual behavior for later reconciliation.

Discovery mode is especially important for a mobile app because embedded sensors, location categories, motion state, app activity, calendar context, and explicit quick notes may help reconstruct what happened during undetailed or under-specified time periods.

Discovery mode must preserve user sovereignty. Sensor-derived, integration-derived, or inferred observations are evidence, not final truth. Ambiguous periods should be reconciled through later Log review, user clarification, or correction before UbU treats them as stable habit patterns, Preference changes, or Objective evidence.

Open details are tracked in `UBU-Q0052`.

---

## 13. Affect

Affect is core in `user_mode`.

Affect belongs to UniverseState.

Affect is not intrinsic to organizations or machines.

### 13.1 MVP affect dimensions

MVP uses simplified user-reportable dimensions:

- energy / tiredness
- stress level
- mood

Values are reported in the range `0.0` to `1.0`.

### 13.2 Mood

Mood is represented as:

- categorical trinary state:
  - `happy`
  - `sad`
  - `angry`
- intensity scalar from `0.0` to `1.0`

`interested/bored` is an independent derived dimension.

### 13.3 Affect snapshots

Affect snapshots are ordinary UniverseState data produced by user query.

They include:

- timestamp
- source: `user`
- per-dimension values

### 13.4 Affect confidence

In MVP, affect confidence decays with age.

Low confidence is determined by algorithm configuration.

Confidence is global across affect dimensions in MVP and may become per-dimension later.

### 13.5 Affect collection Objective

UbU may include an evergreen high-value Objective such as:

> Collect affect information relevant to important usage.

When affect data is missing or stale, the planning algorithm may create direct UI survey Tasks.

### 13.6 Affect constraints

Affect is a constraint-satisfaction concern.

Burnout / affect exhaustion is modeled as a constraint violation rather than a first-class Risk object in MVP.

---

## 14. External Events

An **External Event** is an instantaneous change in the universe.

External Events have no duration and can overlap Tasks.

External Events are not part of feasibility evaluation for an individual Plan in MVP.

Examples:

- GitHub issue comment
- PR opened
- CI failed
- user receives message
- train delay
- another user completes dependent work

External Events may trigger:

- logs
- Objective updates
- Tasks
- recalculation
- worker assignment

### 14.1 External References

An **External Reference** is the canonical many-to-many link between an outside object, record, registry, URL, repository, contract, chat room, payment rail, or other external artifact and a UbU object.

For Phase 1 GitHub dogfooding, External References are first-class objects. They are preferred over embedding all external links directly on Objectives, Tasks, or External Events. Small `external_refs` arrays may still appear on Logs or provenance payloads as convenience pointers, but they are not the authoritative external-link model.

MVP required fields:

- `external_reference_id`
- `external_system`
- `external_object_type`
- `external_object_id`
- `ubu_object_type`
- `ubu_object_id`
- `relation_type`
- `confidence`
- `created_by_identity_ref`
- `created_at`
- `last_verified_at`
- `sync_policy`
- `projection_policy`
- `provenance`

MVP target object types include Objective, Task, External Event, and Log entry. This allows one GitHub Issue to support multiple Objectives, one Objective to reference multiple GitHub Issues, a PR or CI run to become an External Event, and comments, reviews, or CI signals to be retained as evidence for Tasks or Objective updates.

MVP relation types should be a small enum sufficient for GitHub dogfooding: `represents`, `supports`, `evidence_for`, `source_event_for`, `projection_of`, `duplicate_of`, and `supersedes`. Later integrations may add relation types through explicit schema migration rather than free-form strings.

Duplicate detection uses a normalized uniqueness key over `external_system`, `external_object_type`, `external_object_id`, `ubu_object_type`, `ubu_object_id`, and `relation_type`. Importers should normalize repository identity, object numbers, node IDs, URLs, and delivery IDs before comparison. A repeated observation of the same normalized external reference updates verification metadata or logs an idempotent no-op; it does not create another external reference. Different relation types between the same objects are allowed when semantically distinct.

Automation Workers may not directly create or mutate canonical External References in Phase 1. A worker may submit an external-reference mutation request when its capability grants allow `mutation_request.submit` for the relevant scope. The canonical instance validates authority, Compartment/export policy, duplicate keys, expected prior version, and provenance before applying or rejecting the request and writing the corresponding Log entry.

---

## 15. Plans and Calendars

### 15.1 Plan

A **Plan** is a finite ordered set of Tasks from a start time to an end time, satisfying Calendar Logic.

A Plan includes:

- Static Tasks
- Dynamic Tasks
- external events

A Plan does not directly contain:

- Containers
- Objectives
- Techniques
- Recipes

Those are logical/model relations outside the calendar-view layer.

Once represented on a Calendar, a Plan is deterministic. It is best understood as a time-independent representation of predicted Actions, similar in shape to a future-facing Log projection. A Plan may eventually include predicted sensor states, expected UniverseState transitions, and other projected observations, but it does not internally evaluate its own probability after it has been materialized.

Plan optimization and default Plan selection are separate operations. Each candidate Plan should be individually optimized for value while satisfying constraints within the modeled world-branch that produced it. The planning algorithm models uncertain parameters such as duration distributions, Task success or failure, external events, interruptions, affect uncertainty, availability changes, and sensor predictions. A particular modeled combination of those parameters can produce a deterministic candidate Plan. UbU may then ascribe a **Plan probability** to that candidate Plan: the probability mass of the modeled branch that yields that deterministic Plan.

### 15.2 Calendar

A **Calendar** is a group of possible Plans.

A Calendar has a default Plan.

The default Plan is the current best recommendation, not a commitment.

The user controls what actually becomes historical log.

### 15.2.1 Default Plan selection

The default Plan is the Plan, or one of multiple tied Plans, with the highest Plan probability overall among the candidate Plans produced for the current Calendar scope.

This does not mean the default Plan is an unoptimized low-value routine. The Plan itself is already value-optimized within its deterministic branch while satisfying dependencies, deadlines, affect constraints, preconditions, and other Calendar Logic. The default selection step chooses among deterministic optimized Plans by Plan probability.

The default Plan is critical to UbU's user experience. Calendar preview must be able to show an ordered upcoming set of Tasks from the current time to the end of the Calendar scope, and each Task should have an explanation of why it appears there: Objective value, dependencies, deadlines, preconditions, affect constraints, worker status, risk findings, or other relevant scheduling reasons.

The ideal search over candidate Plans may be NP-hard or otherwise combinatorially expensive. Practical Compact Calendar implementations should therefore use bounded finite Task instances, time-delta configuration, pruning, greedy baselines, cached subplans, GPU-friendly batch scoring/simulation, device-specific resource limits, and other heuristics. Exact ideality is a north-star property, not a Phase 1 runtime promise.

### 15.2.2 Skeleton Plans and legitimization

The planning pipeline begins with a **skeleton Plan**. A skeleton Plan affixes all Static Tasks and recursively walks backward through dependency DAGs from terminal Static Tasks to dependency roots, then schedules root prerequisites before their dependents. The skeleton Plan is a causal/dependency foundation, not a complete optimized user Plan.

A dependency is a requirement that some state be true before a dependent Task begins. During skeletonization, UbU must check whether that state is already satisfied by the initial UniverseState before inserting prerequisite Tasks. If a viable skeleton Plan cannot be created, the planning model is blocked, contradictory, incomplete, or impossible enough that UbU should stop ordinary planning and ask the user for clarification with a concrete diagnostic explanation.

After skeletonization, UbU performs **legitimization**. Legitimization adds the minimum human-viability constraints and support Tasks needed to make the skeleton Plan plausibly executable by the user. Examples include affect constraints, breaks, recovery Tasks, meals, sleep, transition buffers, setup/teardown time, context-switch limits, and basic sustainability requirements.

The legitimized skeleton Plan is the baseline feasible Plan. Optional Dynamic Tasks, gap-filling work, and richer candidate Plans are compared against it by value, risk, fragility, and user-fit. If full legitimization is cheap, it may be used directly while testing candidate Plans. If it is expensive, UbU should use semi-legitimization heuristics before invoking full legitimization on finalists.

Minimum skeleton Plan representation records:

- Static Task placements with fixed start and end times;
- the dependency DAG frontier used for the current planning scope;
- prerequisite roots whose required state is not already true in the initial UniverseState;
- ordered prerequisite chains and the dependency or precondition refs that justify them;
- initial UniverseState assumptions, including known true, known false, assumed, and unresolved planner-relevant facts;
- unsatisfied dependency diagnostics with the failing Task, missing state, causal chain, and clarification alternatives when available.

Legitimization records the constraints it enforced and any support Tasks or buffers it inserted. The minimum legitimization output includes affect limits in `user_mode`, recovery, breaks, meals, sleep, rest, transition buffers, setup and teardown time, context-switch limits, slack thresholds, dependency-fragility thresholds, and a threshold result of `passed`, `failed`, or `needs_clarification`.

After legitimization, the minimum candidate Plan representation includes materialized Task placements, decision envelopes for movable Tasks, Plan probability metadata, value score, legitimacy threshold result or score, hard-validation status, and explanation lineage back to Objectives, dependencies, preconditions, affect constraints, worker status, risk findings, and probability inputs.

### 15.2.3 Planning horizon and early preparation

The internal planning horizon may exceed the user-visible Calendar window. A one-day visible Calendar may require look-ahead beyond the day to avoid cutting off dependency chains, Techniques, deadlines, or future preparation sequences.

Within reasonable detailed planning windows, such as one day to roughly one week, UbU may bias fragile prerequisite work earlier when that reduces the risk of future impossible choices. This protects users from being forced to make hard tradeoffs while tired, overwhelmed, interrupted, or otherwise emotionally compromised.

This is a bounded operational bias. It should not imply that all distant future work should be pulled forward. For short operational windows, time discounting may usually be treated as negligible unless explicit user Preferences say otherwise. Longer horizons require separate preference and temporal-discounting modeling.

### 15.3 Calendar Logic

Calendar Logic includes constraints such as:

- no overlapping Tasks;
- dependencies respected;
- temporal constraints respected;
- preconditions evaluated;
- affect constraints respected in user mode.

### 15.4 Gaps

Plans may contain gaps.

Gap time is discretionary.

For MVP, gap suggestions are UI suggestions outside the Plan. Future versions may instantiate Gap Tasks.

---

## 16. Compact Calendar

A compact Calendar is a transport/storage representation of a Calendar.

It is intended to efficiently represent a large set of possible Plans.

Compact Calendar support is considered important for MVP because it enables recursive self-analysis and transport between devices/workers.

### 16.1 Compact Calendar concept

A compact Calendar may include:

- Task set;
- Static Tasks;
- Dynamic Tasks;
- skeleton Plan metadata;
- legitimized skeleton baseline;
- ordering constraints;
- duration distributions;
- Task success probabilities;
- external-event trigger distributions;
- modeled interruption distributions;
- affect-state uncertainty and constraints;
- deterministic expansion grammar;
- probability provenance expressions and correlation-group references;
- expansion threshold(s);
- coverage value;
- default Plan reference or materialized default Plan;
- stored user-previewed, risk-report, or debug Plans when policy requires them;
- short-horizon branch cache;
- decision envelopes;
- protected, flexible, and disposable Task metadata;
- cached explanations and repair recipes;
- execution-mode metadata such as time delta, branch horizon, CPU/GPU resource limits, and privacy-routing limits.

### 16.2 Coverage

Coverage belongs to the compact serialization, not the abstract Calendar.

Coverage represents the probability mass of possible futures covered by the compact representation.

The provisional short-horizon branch coverage target is `0.99` probability mass. This should be treated as a configurable heuristic, not as a mathematical guarantee for every device, scope, or resource mode.

After time advances, coverage is recalculated by conditioning the compact Calendar on elapsed time and accepted Logs, Snapshots, External Events, and user actions, then discarding expired branch mass and re-estimating the remaining covered mass.

If recalculated coverage falls below the configured threshold, UbU records a `low_compact_calendar_coverage` recalculation trigger or marks the Calendar stale according to trigger policy. Exact coverage proof is not an MVP requirement.

### 16.3 Planner grammar direction

Compact Calendar planning is no longer framed as a bare DFS process that directly produces the default Plan. The current architecture is:

1. Build the skeleton Plan from Static Tasks and dependency DAGs.
2. Legitimize the skeleton Plan into a minimally human-viable baseline.
3. Generate richer candidate Plans by adding optional Dynamic Tasks and alternative placements.
4. Use semi-legitimization or full legitimization to reject unrealistic candidates.
5. Validate finalists against hard constraints.
6. Select the user-facing default Plan by Plan probability among deterministic candidate Plans.
7. Package compact repair metadata for runtime use.

DFS-like search may still be useful for candidate construction. BFS-like search may still be useful for near-term divergence. Greedy selection may still be useful as a deliberately unintelligent baseline. None of those algorithms is the complete planning architecture by itself.

Execution profiles are additive rather than mutually exclusive. The greedy mean-duration planner is the required MVP benchmark. Local and mobile profiles must support deterministic skeletonization, conservative legitimization, exact hard-constraint checks, local repair recipes, and a short-horizon branch cache. Desktop, worker, and hosted profiles may add DFS-like candidate construction, local search, solver-backed finalist validation, and GPU-friendly scoring or simulation. GPU or learned search may propose and score candidates, but exact or conservative validation certifies the selected Plan.

Plan probability is represented internally as probability metadata rather than only as a display scalar. The minimum record contains a display scalar, a log probability for stable computation, an optional probability interval, provenance over the modeled probabilistic inputs, and correlation-group or scenario references when inputs are not independent. Implementations may multiply probabilities only for inputs declared independent. Correlated or unknown relationships must use joint scenarios, shared random variables, correlation groups, or conservative intervals rather than pretending independence.

### 16.4 Reactive short-horizon branch layer

The default Plan is not enough for real-time use because reality can diverge from the modeled branch. UbU therefore also needs a lightweight reactive layer, likely BFS-like, policy-based, or repair-recipe-based, that starts at the current instant and maintains a short-horizon cache or reconstruction path for high-probability near-term alternatives.

The reactive layer should cover near-term alternatives involving planned Tasks, duration variation, early completion, late completion, interruptions, relevant external events, affect shifts, user overrides, and immediate recalculation triggers. The provisional default horizon is one hour. Mobile-only, low-power, or offline operation may shorten this horizon.

This layer exists to let the user's current Calendar and Log update quickly when something actually happens. It should not attempt to enumerate every possible future to the end of the Calendar scope.

### 16.5 Mobile stewardship metadata

A compact Calendar should carry metadata that lets constrained devices preserve legitimacy without performing full global replanning. Useful metadata includes:

- protected, flexible, and disposable Task criticality;
- decision envelopes such as earliest start, latest finish, and movable windows;
- cached explanations for why a Task matters and what depends on it;
- conflict severity levels;
- last-legitimate-Plan references;
- simple repair recipes;
- recovery-critical and deadline-fragile markers;
- recalculation triggers and remote-assist eligibility.

The MVP-friendly subset is Task criticality, last legitimate Plan storage, simple repair rules, conflict severity levels, cached explanations, next-best-action mode, and basic decision envelopes. Rich branch packaging and learned local policy models are post-MVP by default.

### 16.6 Early completion and forward-pull behavior

When a Task completes earlier than expected, the default behavior should be to pull the next valid Dynamic Task forward to the present time if dependencies, preconditions, affect constraints, location constraints, and other Calendar Logic allow it.

This supports a conservative duration bias: when uncertain, the scheduler may prefer duration estimates that are not overly optimistic. Early completion then becomes easy to absorb by starting the next valid Dynamic Task immediately rather than leaving useless gaps or requiring disruptive global replanning.

Static Tasks retain fixed start times. If no predetermined Dynamic Task can validly fill time before the next Static Task, the planner should consider gap-filling suggestions. The design of evergreen Dynamic Tasks or evergreen Objective-maintenance Tasks is still open and tracked separately.

### 16.7 Adaptive granularity and offline operation

Compact Calendar planning should support configurable time deltas.

Provisional defaults:

- full-detail planning delta: `1 minute`;
- mobile moderate delta: `5 minutes`;
- mobile low-power or offline delta: `15 minutes`;
- reactive branch horizon: `1 hour`;
- short-horizon branch coverage target: `0.99` probability mass.

A one-minute delta aligns with common calendar behavior and should be available when compute resources permit it. Mobile-only operation may use coarser granularity to preserve battery, reduce memory and CPU/GPU load, and keep local recalculation responsive. Offline or low-power mode may dynamically switch to a coarser delta, such as fifteen minutes, while preserving the core UbU experience.

Known offline windows, such as flights or planned disconnection, should trigger preparatory precomputation while connectivity and compute are available. If the offline state is unexpected, UbU should gracefully degrade to cached state, local explicit algorithms, coarser deltas, reduced branch depth, and mobile stewardship metadata.

### 16.8 GPU-aware execution backends and privacy boundary

The open-core planning loop must not depend on a hidden cloud service. Mobile-only UbU must preserve the core UbU experience, but it should do so as a real-time steward of Plan legitimacy, user agency, and next-action clarity rather than as the full global optimizer.

Cloud or external compute may improve performance, granularity, analysis depth, branch coverage, and expensive legitimization, but must not be a hidden mandatory dependency for the open-core planning loop. Solver selection should treat GPU suitability as a first-class criterion. CPU or conservative exact logic should certify skeleton validity, hard constraints, contradiction diagnostics, and explanations; GPU-capable search, simulation, scoring, and learned-model inference should handle large candidate sets, stochastic robustness, affect scoring, and premium cloud planning where available.

Possible execution backends include:

- local mobile execution;
- local desktop or laptop execution;
- Phase 2 user-owned worker devices;
- dedicated user-owned worker appliances;
- UbU corporate hosted compute;
- third-party UbU-compatible compute providers;
- future privacy-preserving compute services such as practical FHE-backed or comparable encrypted computation.

The FOSS planner and Compact Calendar representation should be backend-agnostic. Execution providers are interchangeable through explicit APIs, capability grants, Compartment policy, provenance, and user-visible routing decisions. GPU search may propose candidate Plans, but hard constraints and final Plan validity must be certified by exact or conservative validation. Cloud planning payloads should minimize PII and transmit only the structured timing, dependency, value, constraint, criticality, and legitimacy information needed for the selected provider.

### 16.9 MVP Compact Calendar implementation

The minimum Phase 1 Compact Calendar implementation stores the legitimized skeleton baseline, the default Plan, the active execution profile, coverage estimate, decision envelopes, Task criticality, cached explanation fragments, probability provenance, and last-legitimate-Plan reference. It stores user-previewed, risk-report, and debug/reproducibility Plans only when those artifacts are actually generated or needed for audit.

High-probability near-term alternatives within the reactive horizon may be stored as materialized branches or as deterministic reconstruction instructions. Non-selected candidate Plans, expensive global repairs, and low-probability branches are reconstructed on demand from the compact grammar, current UniverseState, Logs, Snapshots, External Events, repair recipes, and cached provenance.

MVP planning does not require exhaustive optimal search, cloud compute, GPU execution, exact coverage proof, learned policy models, or a complete transport grammar for every post-MVP uncertainty source. The required implementation is a deterministic skeletonizer, minimum legitimizer, greedy baseline, bounded candidate expansion, hard-constraint validator, Plan probability/provenance record, compact default-Plan package, short-horizon repair cache or reconstruction path, and low-coverage recalculation trigger.

---

## 17. Logs

A **Log** is the canonical record of what actually happened in the universe.

A Log consists of timestamped entries recording:

- Task completion or failure
- External Events that occurred
- Observed Snapshots (user-declared or sensor-derived state)
- Objective status transitions
- Plan realizations
- Decisions made and by whom
- System recalculations

Logs are immutable once written, but may be annotated or corrected through new entries.

### 17.1 MVP Log entry fields

MVP Log entries use a shared event envelope. Required fields:

- `log_entry_id`
- `schema_version`
- `instance_id`
- `recorded_at`
- `effective_at`
- `event_type`
- `actor_identity_ref`
- `recorded_by_device_ref`
- `target_ref`
- `result`
- `event_payload`
- `provenance`

`recorded_at` is when UbU accepted the entry. `effective_at` is when the modeled event occurred and may be earlier for imported or reconstructed events. `target_ref` identifies the primary canonical object or imported External Event. `result` is one of `success`, `failure`, `partial`, or `not_applicable`. `event_payload` is JSON-compatible event-specific data.

Optional fields:

- `old_value`
- `new_value`
- `reason`
- `notes`
- `confidence`
- `related_plan_ref`
- `external_refs`
- `annotation_of`
- `correction_of`
- `idempotency_key`

`old_value` and `new_value` are used for mutation-like events and may be absent for observational, external-only, or compartment-sensitive records. `provenance` records the source kind and source reference; `confidence` is stored when the entry is inferred, sensor-derived, imported, or worker-submitted.

### 17.2 MVP Log event types

MVP event types are:

- `task_completed`
- `task_failed`
- `task_moot`
- `external_event_observed`
- `snapshot_observed`
- `objective_transitioned`
- `plan_realized`
- `decision_recorded`
- `recalculation_triggered`
- `worker_mutation_submitted`
- `worker_mutation_applied`
- `worker_mutation_rejected`
- `log_annotation_added`
- `log_correction_added`

All event types share the required envelope. Event-specific details live in `event_payload` and may be validated by event-specific schemas.

### 17.3 Immutability, annotation, and correction

Log entries are append-only. Annotation and correction never modify the original entry. They create a new Log entry with `event_type` set to `log_annotation_added` or `log_correction_added`, and with `annotation_of` or `correction_of` pointing to the original `log_entry_id`.

Corrections supersede interpretation of the original entry but do not erase the original historical claim. Later queries should resolve corrected views by following correction links.

### 17.4 Storage, retention, and query

Canonical Logs are stored per UbU instance. Device-local Logs or queues may exist as transport and audit buffers, but canonical history belongs to the instance; each entry records `recorded_by_device_ref` when known.

MVP retention is indefinite for canonical Logs. Archival may move old entries to colder local storage, but must preserve queryability and integrity. Deletion or redaction policies are governed by Compartment retention rules and remain post-MVP except where required by a hard Compartment invariant.

MVP query/search is index-backed over `recorded_at`, `effective_at`, `event_type`, `actor_identity_ref`, `target_ref`, `external_refs`, and correction/annotation links. Large histories should be queried by time-windowed, cursor-paginated APIs. Derived search indexes may be rebuilt from the append-only Log.

### 17.5 Automation Worker contributions

Automation Workers contribute to Logs through their worker Identity. A worker may submit events or mutation requests, but the canonical instance validates authority and writes the canonical Log entry. Accepted worker mutations create applied entries; invalid or unauthorized attempts create rejected entries.

Worker-supplied `idempotency_key`, provenance, evidence references, and confidence metadata are retained when available so duplicate submissions and stale worker results can be detected.

### 17.6 Log vs Plan

- **Plan**: a possible ordered sequence of future Tasks, representing prediction
- **Log**: a timestamped record of what actually occurred, representing reality

Plans are inherently multiple. Logs are singular and authoritative for the specific timeline that occurred.

### 17.7 Log and Feedback

Logs enable feedback loops. A Log records the gap between prediction and reality, enabling better future planning.

The comparison of Logs against Plans is essential for:

- detecting estimation errors
- updating probability models
- surfacing unmodeled constraints
- improving forecasting algorithms

### 17.8 Regular Log review

Log review is a notable Task that should run regularly. Its purpose is to keep UbU's model aligned with the user's actual behavior, later reflection, and corrections.

A Log review Task may:

- reconcile undetailed or under-specified time periods;
- ask whether a user override reflected a better local judgment, bad timing, missing preconditions, wrong duration estimate, stale affect data, social pressure, or changed Preference;
- compare planned Tasks against completed, failed, moot, snoozed, rejected, or unobserved Tasks;
- convert user-approved observations into corrected Logs, Snapshots, Preferences, Objective annotations, Task estimate updates, or recalculation triggers;
- mark proposed habit patterns as user-endorsed, tolerated, unwanted, or unresolved.

Log review should not become a blame ritual. It is a model-maintenance Task for self-governance. Open details are tracked in `UBU-Q0053`.

---

## 18. Identities

An **Identity** is the external-facing communication and authorization surface.

Humans may have multiple Identities.

Organizations and workers are also represented through Identities externally.

UbU interacts with outside agents through Identities, not directly through metaphysical assumptions about humans.

Examples:

- personal identity
- family identity
- GitHub identity
- pseudonymous identity
- worker identity
- organization identity


---

## 19. Associations

An **Association** is an Identity-scoped, perspective-bound model of an emergent group-like coordination pattern.

Associations may be formal or informal, temporary or durable, economic or non-economic, intimate or impersonal, public or pseudonymous. Examples include:

- friend groups;
- parties and event cohorts;
- amateur sports leagues;
- FOSS projects;
- contributor crews;
- skill networks;
- private or public marketplaces;
- nonprofits;
- companies;
- DAO-like projects;
- conference outreach networks.

An Association is not an objective interpersonal object by default. UbU should not assume that an Association has one globally authoritative membership list, role list, boundary, or decision authority. Instead, an Association is modeled from the perspective of a particular Identity and supported by evidence, attestations, Relationships, shared Objectives, commitments, norms, Logs, and External References.

A legal entity filing, GitHub organization, website, governance document, Discord server, IRC log, board meeting note, contract, or payment address may be a strong External Reference. It is still not the whole Association. It proves or supports a limited claim about an external record, not every social fact about the group.

### 19.1 Association fields, provisional

A future Association object may include:

- `association_id`
- `perceived_by_identity_ref`
- `label`
- `description`
- `association_kind`
- `lifecycle_state`
- `compartment_ref`
- `perceived_member_refs`
- `perceived_objective_refs`
- `perceived_norms`
- `perceived_commitment_refs`
- `relationship_refs`
- `external_reference_refs`
- `evidence_refs`
- `confidence`

Full Association implementation is not required for Phase 1. Phase 1 may represent EthConf/outreach dogfooding through existing Objectives, Tasks, Logs, Relationships, External Events, and External References, plus manually structured or fixture-backed candidate AssociationAttestations.

### 19.2 AssociationAttestations

An **AssociationAttestation** is a claim by an Identity, human operator, Automation Worker, parser, or LLM-assisted workflow about an Association.

Possible claim types include:

- membership;
- non-membership;
- role;
- authority;
- commitment;
- objective;
- norm;
- governance rule;
- capability;
- reputation;
- relationship;
- operational priority;
- mission alignment;
- dissolution or dormancy.

LLM-generated AssociationAttestations are candidate claims. They require provenance, source references, confidence, review status, and disclosure policy. They must not be treated as authoritative social truth merely because they were generated from a large corpus.

### 19.3 SharedAssociationDescriptor

A **SharedAssociationDescriptor** is a future coordination artifact that multiple Identities may sign, accept, or reference.

It may describe a shared label, purpose, declared mission, governance rules, public references, contribution paths, membership or participation criteria, disclosure policy, and other declared facts. It is not a God's-eye Association. It is a shared artifact that different Identities may adopt, dispute, supersede, or interpret differently.

### 19.4 Organizational introspection

**Organizational introspection** is the process of reviewing an Association's evidence-bearing records and asking whether actual behavior matches declared goals.

Possible inputs include:

- README and governance documents;
- issue trackers and pull requests;
- release notes and roadmaps;
- meeting notes and board minutes;
- public or permissioned Discord, Matrix, Slack, IRC, or forum logs;
- calendar events;
- grant or milestone records;
- outreach notes and follow-up records.

Outputs should be reviewable artifacts:

- evidence-backed AssociationAttestations;
- mission-alignment questions;
- priority-drift warnings;
- undocumented-role observations;
- commitment-mismatch reports;
- follow-up Tasks;
- public or redacted retrospective artifacts.

The organizational-introspection hook for outreach is: `Can your project prove from its records that it is actually committed to achieving its stated goals?` In design terms, this means operational proof through auditable evidence trails and reviewed attestations, not mathematical certainty or an LLM truth oracle.

## 20. Contextual Messaging and Message Extraction

A **Message Context Envelope** is a bounded metadata wrapper around a human-readable message or external message reference.

It exists because ordinary legacy messages often under-specify the planning context needed by the receiver. A flat text request such as `can you grab milk?` may imply a household Objective, a grocery Task, a route constraint, a known Relationship, a typical milk type, a soft deadline, and a low-to-medium interrupt level. Legacy systems usually transmit only the text and a small amount of transport metadata.

A future Message Context Envelope may include:

- `message_id`;
- `source_system`;
- `transport_reference` or External Reference;
- `sender_identity_ref`;
- `receiver_identity_ref` or intended audience;
- `channel_ref` or Association reference;
- `raw_body` or content reference;
- `message_kind`;
- `topic`;
- `objective_refs`;
- `task_refs` or candidate Task description;
- `priority`;
- `interrupt_recommendation`;
- `response_expectation`;
- `deadline_or_review_window`;
- `assumptions`;
- `ambiguities`;
- `provenance`;
- `confidence`;
- `disclosure_policy`;
- `compartment_ref`.

A **Message Extraction Result** is a candidate interpretation produced by an Automation Worker, parser, or LLM-assisted extractor from raw or semi-structured communication. It should distinguish:

- facts explicit in the message;
- facts explicit in channel or transport metadata;
- facts inferred from thread context;
- facts inferred from Relationship history;
- facts inferred from Association context;
- model guesses;
- user-confirmed corrections.

Message extraction is advisory until accepted into canonical state. The extractor may propose Tasks, Events, Objective updates, Relationship observations, AssociationAttestations, or communication-review items, but it should not silently mutate canonical state.

### 20.1 Native UbU-to-UbU contextual messaging

Native UbU-to-UbU communication should allow a sender to disclose selected context intentionally. The receiving instance can then use that context to triage the message against the current Plan.

A minimal Phase 3 implementation should support enough metadata for priority and interrupt decisions. Richer subjective Relationship context, detailed Association reconciliation, and multi-party trust semantics may remain post-MVP.

The future inter-instance protocol should be a generic envelope family, not a separate protocol for every feature. Message delivery, worker assignment, status reporting, mutation-request submission, capability-grant exchange, External Event submission, and recalculation requests should share Identity, capability, Compartment, provenance, idempotency, and review semantics.

Phase 1 worker communication is a narrow worker API profile of that direction, not the full Phase 3 protocol. It may use simpler local or parent-specific endpoints, but its request, status, mutation, projection, and Log-submission shapes should intentionally avoid contradicting the future protocol.

Phase 3 multi-user coordination can then extend the same envelope family with Message Context Envelopes and user-to-user Identity commitments while preserving bounded disclosure. Native user messages are one protocol payload type; they do not get permission to bypass worker-style authority, validation, or admission rules.

### 20.2 Legacy communication adapters

Legacy adapters may ingest or emit messages through systems such as WhatsApp, SMS, email, Discord, IRC, Slack, Matrix, or similar systems when permitted by the user and the service boundary.

If only one party has UbU, the message remains a flat legacy input and UbU may locally extract candidate structure. If both parties have UbU, the instances may upgrade the exchange by attaching, linking, side-channeling, or otherwise associating a Message Context Envelope with the legacy message.

This is an interoperability bridge, not a reason to leak hidden local state. Each field must be filtered through Identity, Compartment, disclosure, and recipient policy.

### 20.3 Structured extraction model strategy

The initial extractor strategy should use general LLMs or local models constrained by schemas, validation, and repair loops. A specialized fine-tuned or distilled extractor model may become valuable later after UbU has stable schemas and corrected training examples.

The system should not require a new foundation model. The likely requirement is reliable structured extraction, not open-ended conversation.

### 20.4 Personalized TTS and voice descriptors

A **Voice Profile Descriptor** is a future optional communication metadata object that may describe pronunciation, cadence, voice style, or a reference to an approved local voice profile.

The intended use is expressive and accessibility-oriented rendering: a receiver may convert text into spoken audio approximating the sender's usual style without receiving a noisy full audio recording. This can compress communication from audio to text plus metadata.

Voice descriptors are sensitive. They must be opt-in, policy-governed, clearly separated from authentication, and protected against deceptive impersonation.

---


## 21. Agentic Interaction, MCP, and Delegation Substrate

This section records the post-realtime LLM and agentic-platform design direction. The core rule is that unstructured AI can observe, converse, propose, and act under authority, but UbU remains the canonical state-transition, review, privacy, and planning layer.

### 21.1 Realtime interaction sessions

A realtime interaction session is a bounded period in which UbU receives a continuous or semi-continuous stream from text, voice, video, sensors, tools, or a model provider.

Possible session modes include:

- `off`;
- `text_only`;
- `voice_session`;
- `meeting_logging`;
- `discovery_mode`;
- `local_only_realtime`;
- `cloud_assisted_realtime`.

Realtime sessions may produce candidate updates, but they do not directly mutate canonical state. Candidate update types include observed events, interruption signals, Task progress deltas, affect signals, Plan deviations, external condition changes, clarification questions, WorkItem candidates, LogEntry candidates, and AssociationAttestation candidates.

A realtime model's sense of elapsed time is evidence. Planner-time semantics are determined by UbU's explicit Task, Plan, Calendar, Log, Snapshot, and recalculation rules.

### 21.2 Structured-output admission pipeline

LLM, parser, worker, and agent outputs should follow an admission pipeline:

```text
output
  -> schema validation
  -> semantic validation
  -> Compartment and policy validation
  -> provenance and confidence attachment
  -> conflict detection
  -> user-review classification
  -> accepted canonical object or rejected candidate
```

This applies to structured message extraction, realtime observations, AssociationAttestations, Tasks, Log candidates, Plan repairs, Delegation Substrate packets, and agent outputs.

### 21.3 ContextBundle

A `ContextBundle` is a governed package of context sent to a model, tool, worker, or agent.

Provisional fields:

- `context_bundle_id`;
- `purpose`;
- `source_refs`;
- `compartment_refs`;
- `identity_refs_exposed`;
- `association_refs_exposed`;
- `destination_provider_ref`;
- `model_or_tool_ref`;
- `redaction_policy`;
- `minimization_notes`;
- `retention_policy`;
- `user_visible_summary`;
- `created_at`;
- `expires_at`;
- `supports_candidate_refs`.

Context assembly is not a low-level implementation detail. It is a privacy decision that must respect Compartment and Identity boundaries.

### 21.4 MCP-style client and server boundary

UbU as an MCP-style client may call external tools and services. UbU as an MCP-style server may expose narrow tool surfaces to external agents.

Safe tool surfaces should prefer candidate submission and queries over direct mutation. Examples:

- `task_candidate.create`;
- `log_candidate.submit`;
- `plan_summary.read`;
- `plan_repair.submit`;
- `objective_status.query`;
- `clarification.request`;
- `association_attestation_candidate.submit`;
- `delegation_packet.prepare`;
- `projection_preview.submit`.

Capability grants should scope these operations by object, Objective subtree, Task set, Compartment, Identity, integration, operation kind, time window, cost budget, and review requirement.

### 21.5 Delegation Substrate

A Delegation Substrate packet prepares a Task for execution by making the work explicit enough to hand off, automate, review, or perform oneself with less ambiguity.

Provisional fields:

- `delegation_packet_id`;
- `task_ref` or `objective_ref`;
- `purpose`;
- `executor_type` (`self`, `local_agent`, `remote_agent`, `tool`, `human_identity`, `association`, `general_contractor`, `external_provider`);
- `executor_ref` when known;
- `authority_source`;
- `authority_scope`;
- `expected_output`;
- `required_evidence`;
- `review_requirement`;
- `privacy_scope`;
- `compartment_refs`;
- `allowed_tools`;
- `timebox_or_deadline`;
- `failure_path`;
- `escalation_path`;
- `status`.

Status values may include `not_delegated`, `prepared`, `proposed`, `offered`, `accepted`, `in_progress`, `delivered`, `reviewed`, `rejected`, `completed`, and `cancelled`.

When `executor_type` is `self`, the packet acts as a self-reminder and execution aid. It does not imply external handoff.

### 21.6 General Contractor

A General Contractor coordinates multiple subordinate executors to satisfy an Objective or complete a Container of Tasks.

A General Contractor may be a human Identity, agent, or Association. The role may decompose work, assign subtasks, monitor status, request evidence, and submit candidate updates, but only within explicit authority and Compartment bounds.

Open details include subdelegation, authority propagation, budget constraints, evidence requirements, review rights, and failure/escalation semantics.

### 21.7 Skill Barter marketplace direction

The Skill Barter marketplace is a future specialization of Association coordination and Delegation Substrate, not a Phase 1 public marketplace.

It may eventually support privacy-preserving skilled-work exchange, pseudonymous capability claims, reputation without unnecessary doxxing, scoped work agreements, private or selective-disclosure evidence, lawful user-controlled settlement references, and human/agentic executor discovery.

For EthConf and cypherpunk outreach, Skill Barter is useful as a future-direction signal: UbU can preserve cryptocurrency-native values of voluntary coordination, sovereign identity, privacy, FOSS development, and open markets without becoming token-first or speculation-first.

### 21.8 AgentAction and BackgroundProcess

An `AgentAction` is a bounded action by an agent or tool against an external surface. A `BackgroundProcess` is a recurring or conditional process that may run without occupying user Calendar time.

Provisional shared fields:

- `actor_identity_ref`;
- `agent_or_tool_ref`;
- `trigger`;
- `schedule_or_condition`;
- `authority_scope`;
- `credential_refs`;
- `compartment_refs`;
- `external_surface_refs`;
- `irreversible_side_effect`;
- `prompt_injection_exposure`;
- `compute_or_cost_budget`;
- `notification_policy`;
- `rollback_or_mitigation_path`;
- `completion_evidence`;
- `failure_escalation_policy`.

These objects are not equivalent to ordinary user Calendar events. They may consume compute, credentials, money, privacy budget, or external authority without consuming the user's direct time.

### 21.9 State-transition cockpit

The long-term UX should present the current state transition and its evidence, constraints, expected effects, authority, privacy scope, and available actions.

Phase 1 proves this through one recommended next Task and an inspectable explanation. Later cockpit surfaces may include message triage, Log review, Plan repair, Delegation Substrate packets, agent approvals, AssociationAttestation review, organizational introspection, and projection publication.


## 22. Relationships

A **Relationship** is structured UniverseState data representing the relationship between two Identities.

MVP Relationship data includes:

- two identity refs;
- one identity controlled by the user;
- user-stated affect state toward the other identity;
- inferred/speculated affect state of the other identity toward the user.

Communication and maintenance metadata are not stored directly on Relationship in MVP. Cadence policy for "keep this relationship warm" lives on an evergreen Objective's recurrence/reactivation rule. Observed interactions live in Logs, External Events, Task history, or Compartment/external references, depending on source and sensitivity.

Objectives attach to Relationships indirectly through UniverseState. A relationship-maintenance Objective points at the Relationship or relationship-relevant UniverseState key, and its Tasks mutate ordinary UniverseState or append events; they do not add a special Relationship-maintenance schema in MVP.

Neglect risk is not stored on Relationship in MVP. It is a risk-report finding derived from the maintenance Objective's recurrence rule plus observed interaction history and current Plan state.

---

## 23. Zones, Devices, and Compartments

### 23.1 Device

A **Device** is an execution enclave, not necessarily physical hardware.

Examples:

- OS user profile
- container
- VM
- secure enclave

One physical machine may host multiple Devices.

### 23.2 Zone

A **Zone** is a workspace-like UbU instance context.

A Device belongs to one Zone.

A Zone may have many Devices.

Zones maintain explicit allowlists/denylists of Compartments, defaulting to deny.

### 23.3 Compartment

A **Compartment** is a first-class data containment object.

Compartments enforce hard invariants that the user cannot casually override.

Hard invariants may include:

- storage backend constraints
- device eligibility constraints
- identity disclosure constraints
- export/integration constraints
- retention constraints
- audit constraints

#### Phase 1 Compartment baseline

Phase 1 implements Compartments as explicit classification and routing guardrails, not as the complete Phase 2 multi-device containment system. The minimum Phase 1 promise is:

- Compartment-marked content stores a `compartment_ref` and is handled through references rather than embedded in ordinary WorkItem structure.
- A Compartment may declare `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, `allowed_integration_refs`, and `allowed_device_refs` policies.
- Content in a `no_cloud_llm` Compartment must not be sent to cloud LLM routes. Content in a `no_external_export` Compartment must not be exported, projected, or handed to workers except as redacted structural references.
- Other Compartment-marked content may cross a boundary only through an allowed route and a user-visible action. Boundary-crossing attempts that reach UbU are recorded in Logs as allowed or denied.
- In Phase 1, device eligibility is limited to the current single local Device / execution enclave and configured allowlists. Hardware attestation, cross-device partial replication enforcement, and cryptographic isolation are not MVP claims.
- Phase 1 does not promise automated retention deletion or redaction for Compartment content. Retention policies may be recorded, but enforcement beyond append-only Log retention is post-MVP unless separately implemented and disclosed.

Phase 1 public messaging must describe this as a minimal Compartment guardrail layer. It must not claim complete privacy isolation, complete retention enforcement, secure multi-device Compartments, or protection from a malicious local administrator.

### 23.4 Sensitive content

WorkItems must remain structurally usable without dereferencing sensitive content.

Sensitive Compartment data should be referenced by link/reference, not embedded in WorkItem structure.

Un-compartmented content is treated as low-security and may require per-integration prompts.

In Phase 1, un-compartmented content is explicitly labeled `security_level: low`. Low-security content may be used by configured integrations or cloud LLM-backed Automation Workers after a user-visible integration or worker action, but UbU must not market that content as compartment-protected.

### 23.5 Phase 1 local-first and cloud LLM disclosure

Phase 1 can honestly claim that canonical planning state, Logs, and source-linked project model data live in the local single-user UbU instance by default. It cannot claim Phase 2 local-first sync, conflict handling, partial replication, or secure multi-device Compartment propagation.

Phase 1 can honestly claim that cloud LLM usage is optional, explicit, and advisory. Cloud LLMs may be used by configured Automation Workers, Super Automation flows, or bootstrap tools such as model-committee, but they are not the canonical planner and must not receive `no_cloud_llm` Compartment content. When a workflow uses cloud LLMs on un-compartmented low-security content, the UI or run artifact must disclose that routing before or at execution time.

---

## 24. Automation Workers and Super Automation

### 24.1 Automation Worker

An **Automation Worker** is a worker-mode UbU instance or compatible execution unit that performs delegated work.

Automation Workers may:

- run LLM queries;
- process photos or screenshots;
- label GitHub events;
- perform external API actions;
- run document analysis;
- submit authorized mutations to a canonical UbU instance.

A worker-mode instance is externally represented as an Identity.

### 24.1.1 Worker identity and capabilities

A worker Identity may receive only explicit capability grants. The Identity stores stable external identity metadata and credential references; authority lives in separate capability-grant objects attached to that Identity and issued by a specific parent UbU instance. A grant names allowed actions, scope limits, lifecycle state, issuance time, expiration time when present, and audit/provenance metadata.

Phase 1 capability verbs are:

- `task.read`;
- `objective.read`;
- `universe_state.read_subset`;
- `external_event.append`;
- `snapshot.submit`;
- `mutation_request.submit`;
- `recalculation.request`;
- `projection.github.request_update`.

Workers do not directly mutate canonical Task, Objective, UniverseState, `pipeline_state`, or GitHub projection state in Phase 1. They may submit mutation requests or projection update requests, and the canonical instance validates those requests, writes accepted changes, and logs applied or rejected outcomes. Task creation, Objective creation, Task mutation, Objective mutation, `pipeline_state` mutation, and direct external writes are represented through `mutation_request.submit` or a narrower projection request rather than through direct write authority.

Worker endpoints are the Phase 1 worker profile of the future inter-instance protocol. They should carry the same envelope concerns the later protocol will need: parent instance, worker Identity, capability grant reference, payload kind, target refs, expected prior version or idempotency key where relevant, provenance, Compartment/export decision, and review requirement. Phase 1 does not need to expose native user-to-user messaging or generic remote instance discovery through this API.

Capability grants may be scoped by object ID, Objective subtree, Task set, Compartment, external integration, operation kind, and time window. Compartment policy is a hard upper bound on worker authority: a capability grant cannot authorize access, export, or worker handoff that the relevant Compartment forbids.

A worker may be revoked by disabling or deleting its capability grants, rotating or invalidating credentials, and rejecting later submissions from that grant. Revocation does not rewrite prior Logs. Credential rotation creates a new credential version linked to the same worker Identity and capability grants unless the grant is also changed.

A single worker-mode instance may serve multiple parent organization-mode or user-mode instances only through separate parent-specific capability grants, credentials, and audit trails. Cross-parent data sharing is forbidden unless each parent explicitly grants a route and all relevant Compartment policies allow it. Workers may operate for user-mode instances, but affect and other personal data require especially narrow read-subset grants and must respect `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, and low-security disclosure rules.

A model-committee worker is an Automation Worker pattern that reads canonical project state, runs configured provider workflows against a selected open question or problem, produces candidate changesets, scores candidate changesets, and writes reviewable artifacts.

In v0.1, this means Codex CLI plus local Ollama proposal workflows. In v0.2, this expands to Codex and Claude Code frontier-provider cross-scoring, with local providers remaining useful for diversity and fallback.

In both versions, model-committee is still an external bootstrap tool rather than a fully integrated UbU worker-mode runtime component.

### 24.2 Worker mode

Worker mode:

- is one of the three mutually exclusive UbU modes;
- is usually daemon/service-oriented;
- may expose an admin web UI;
- may use CLI settings;
- often runs on GPU-capable hardware;
- may control cloud compute resources.

### 24.2.1 Worker-mode public UX

Worker-mode public UX is an administrative console for the worker operator, not the primary planning UI.

The first worker-mode screen should show:

- connection and identity status for the parent UbU instance;
- current service health and last check-in;
- active assignment, assignment queue, and retry/error state;
- granted capabilities and their scopes;
- recent Log submissions, mutation requests, and rejection reasons;
- local resource status, including GPU availability and cloud compute state when applicable.

The worker UI may expose detailed logs and operational controls, but it should default to summarized, redacted views. It must not expose Compartment-protected payloads, broader organization planning state, or personal affect data merely because the worker executed related work.

No worker-mode web admin UI is required for Phase 1. Phase 1 only needs enough visible worker assignment/status information for the GitHub dogfooding demo, which may be shown in the user-mode dogfooding UI, CLI output, or run artifacts.

### 24.3 Super Automation

**Super Automation** is a product/UX pattern, not the technical name of the device.

Super Automation uses Automation Workers, local services, or external APIs to abstract away difficult external interactions from the user.

It may include:

- screenshot interpretation;
- user-mediated UI actions;
- GitHub processing;
- document parsing;
- API work;
- LLM-assisted workflow execution.

---

## 25. Organization Mode

Organization mode is an instance-wide option.

It is isolated from personal user-mode installations.

Organization mode:

- does not model intrinsic affect;
- may disable affect dimensions on Relationship objects;
- may use organizational Preferences as directives;
- may use authority-source metadata/logging;
- may delegate work to Automation Workers;
- may expose a web interface.

For MVP, roles/RBAC may be omitted and all users treated as admin-equivalent.

### 25.1 Organization-mode object rules

Organization mode uses the shared core object model unless a field or behavior is intrinsically personal-affect-specific. Objective, Preference, Task, Container, UniverseState, Snapshot, Plan, Calendar, Log, Identity, Relationship, Compartment, Automation Worker, External Event, External Reference, and deferred Association-related objects are available in organization mode to the depth needed by the instance's project-planning workflow.

Intrinsic affect fields are structurally absent from organization-mode objects where a mode-specific schema is used. Where a shared storage schema contains affect-capable fields for implementation convenience, those fields are disabled in organization mode and validation must reject organization-created intrinsic-affect values rather than merely ignoring them. Organization mode may still store non-intrinsic human-related project constraints, availability facts, risk-report findings, or externally supplied structural signals when those signals are allowed by source authority, Compartment policy, and consent/export rules.

Relationship objects may exist in organization mode without affect dimensions. An organization-mode Relationship represents structured UniverseState between Identities, such as contributor, maintainer, worker, project, vendor, or integration relationships. It may carry non-affect project metadata through ordinary UniverseState facts, External Events, Logs, External References, candidate AssociationAttestations, Objectives, or Tasks, but it must not claim the organization has a private emotional state toward another Identity.

Organization-created Objectives, Preferences, and Tasks require `authority_source` metadata. For MVP, `authority_source` may be coarse and may identify an admin-equivalent operator Identity, imported project policy, imported external event, Automation Worker submission, or human-approved projection/import action. The detailed authority-source vocabulary remains tracked by `UBU-Q0013`.

Before RBAC exists, organization-mode users are represented as human operator Identities with admin-equivalent authority over the organization-mode instance. This is an MVP authority simplification, not a claim that all future organization users have the same role. Actions still write Logs with actor Identity and provenance so later RBAC can be introduced without erasing earlier history.

Future personal `user_mode` instances may provide limited signals to an organization-mode instance only through explicit user-controlled sharing, Identity-mediated authorization, Compartment/export checks, and clear provenance. Phase 1 does not implement cross-instance personal-to-organization sharing. Later designs should prefer structural signals such as availability, commitment status, task completion, or user-approved projection summaries rather than raw affect, private relationship state, or broad personal context.

### 25.2 Organization-mode public UX

Organization-mode public UX is a project operations dashboard for human operators of an organization or project instance.

The first organization-mode screen should show:

- pipeline state for imported/project WorkItems and Objectives;
- risk summary for current Plans, including deadline, dependency, and worker bottleneck risk;
- worker assignments, worker health, and pending mutation requests;
- GitHub projection and reconciliation status;
- recent decision, projection, and worker Log entries that need operator attention.

Organization mode may expose pipeline state, risk reports, worker assignments, and GitHub projection status as first-class public UI concepts. It should not expose personal user-mode affect surfaces, and admin-equivalent MVP assumptions must be labeled when no full RBAC is implemented.

No organization-mode web admin UI is required for Phase 1. The Phase 1 public demo may show organization-like project coordination data, but the required UI is the single-user dogfooding surface defined by the Phase 1 demo criteria, not a general organization console.

---

## 26. GitHub Dogfooding and Projection

GitHub is a projection of UbU state, not the source of truth.

UbU should be able to use GitHub as an interface for FOSS contributors while maintaining canonical state internally.

### 26.1 GitHub object mapping

Provisional mapping:

- GitHub Issue → one or more Objectives
- Objective → one or more GitHub Issues
- GitHub PR → External Event and/or analysis Objective
- Review request → Task
- CI failure → External Event and/or analysis Objective
- Milestone/release → Objective with Calendar detail
- Contributor comment → External Event and/or analysis Objective

Contributor interactions may also be associated with a GitHub Identity and relationship-maintenance Objective when the user has explicitly modeled that contributor relationship. These imported events may update relationship-relevant UniverseState or satisfy/reactivate the maintenance Objective, but they do not directly rewrite private Relationship affect fields without user acceptance.

### 26.2 Pipeline state

`pipeline_state` is distinct from `Objective.status`.

Candidate pipeline states:

- `unlabeled`
- `invalid`
- `under_specified`
- `valid_unprioritized`
- `unassigned`
- `in_process_awaiting_pr`
- `awaiting_review`
- `awaiting_ci`
- `complete`

### 26.3 GitHub projection

UbU may project data to GitHub through:

- labels
- issue body blocks
- comments
- milestones
- assignees

Recommended MVP rule:

> UbU should only write clearly marked UbU-managed labels, comments, or blocks, and treat all other GitHub edits as external events.

### 26.4 GitHub reconciliation

Missed GitHub updates are expected in MVP.

A reconciliation report should compare GitHub state against UbU state.

Possible comparisons:

- GitHub issues vs UbU Objectives
- GitHub labels vs `pipeline_state`
- GitHub comments vs event log
- PRs / CI vs external events

---

## 27. Risk Reporting

Risk is not a first-class object in MVP.

Risk reports are derived, recalculable analyses over Calendars, Plans, Tasks, Logs, Snapshots, External Events, worker status, External References, and compact Calendar metadata. They do not create canonical Risk objects, and Plan scoring does not include an explicit risk penalty in MVP.

The Phase 1 MVP report set is:

- `p90_completion_time`
- `critical_path`
- `deadline_miss_probability`
- `affect_constraint_violation_probability`
- `low_compact_calendar_coverage_warning`
- `dependency_fragility`
- `worker_or_automation_bottleneck`
- `stale_affect_warning`
- `destructive_pressure_warning`
- `post_plan_depletion_warning`

Additional findings may be computed when the inputs already exist, but they are not required for Phase 1: `relationship_maintenance_neglect_warning`, `preference_uncertainty`, `repeated_override_or_deviation_pattern`, `motivation_mismatch`, `stale_or_missing_discovery_mode_reconciliation`, and `calendar_preview_or_log_review_overdue`.

Risk reports are computed on demand from the current Calendar or Plan. Implementations may cache a risk-report artifact with the Calendar, Plan, run artifact, or release package for auditability and UI performance, but the cache is derived state and must be invalidated or marked stale when relevant Logs, Snapshots, Tasks, worker status, External Events, compact Calendar coverage, or recalculation triggers change.

Automation Workers may compute or refresh risk-report artifacts when granted appropriate read capability, but worker output is advisory until admitted by the canonical instance. Workers may submit report artifacts, report-refresh requests, mutation requests, or projection requests according to their grants; they do not create canonical Risk objects or directly mutate Tasks.

A risk report may recommend or request Tasks. It must not silently create canonical Tasks in MVP. Human-approved or policy-approved follow-up Tasks may include clarification, affect collection, dependency repair, worker retry/escalation, Calendar regeneration, Log review, Calendar preview, or GitHub projection/reconciliation work.

Risk reports are part of release ceremonies for UbU-runs-UbU. A release readiness or release outreach package should include, at minimum, deadline risk, critical path, dependency fragility, worker/automation bottleneck, and low coverage warnings when the inputs exist. Public release artifacts should cite only reviewable report summaries and must not expose sensitive Compartment payloads.

The PERT-superiority demonstration should not claim mathematical replacement of every PERT use. UbU supersedes PERT for its own MVP demo by showing that schedule risk is not only a duration network: it also includes explicit dependency/precondition state, affect constraints, worker status, compact Calendar coverage, recalculation from Logs and Snapshots, and actionable next Task or Plan repair recommendations.

Burnout / affect exhaustion is modeled as a constraint violation.

Affect-related risk reports should name plan fragility, not user blame. Phase 1 reports may include affect constraint violation probability, destructive-pressure warnings, stale-affect warnings, repeated late-failure warnings, and post-plan depletion warnings. These findings are derived from Plans, Logs, Snapshots, and risk-report analysis rather than first-class Risk objects.

## 28. Recalculation Triggers

Recalculation triggers are explicit records that tell UbU when a Calendar, Plan, risk-report cache, explanation cache, or next-action recommendation may no longer reflect current state. A trigger does not mutate domain state by itself; it points at the Log entry, Snapshot, External Event, worker request, or clock condition that changed the planner's inputs.

Phase 1 triggers are:

- `task_completed`
- `task_failed`
- `task_moot`
- `observed_snapshot`
- `affect_confidence_decay`
- `external_event`
- `github_update`
- `user_override`
- `calendar_preview_due`
- `log_review_due`
- `discovery_mode_reconciliation_due`
- `elapsed_time`
- `low_compact_calendar_coverage`
- `worker_request`

Phase 1 user controls such as snooze, reject, decompose, and override should be represented through ordinary Task, Log, or user-override payloads rather than separate trigger kinds unless a later implementation proves the distinction is necessary.

Phase 2 triggers are limited to sync and personal-worker conditions that can invalidate the local Calendar: `sync_state_changed`, `device_reconnected`, `remote_worker_status_changed`, and `offline_window_changed`. These are deferred with multi-device local-first sync and user-owned worker coordination.

Post-MVP trigger families include native cross-user message arrival, AssociationAttestation review, broad legacy-message ingestion, background AgentAction policy events, external compute budget or provider changes, and other high-level agentic or multi-user coordination events. They should be modeled through the same trigger envelope when implemented, but they do not block Phase 1.

Accepted Phase 1 triggers are logged with Log event type `recalculation_triggered`. The Log payload should include `trigger_kind`, `scope`, `target_refs`, `source_event_refs`, `requested_action`, `batch_key`, `reason`, and optional `idempotency_key`. `requested_action` is either `recalculate_now` or `mark_calendar_stale`.

Automation Workers do not create canonical triggers directly. A worker with `recalculation.request` may submit a request. The canonical instance validates the worker capability, target scope, Compartment/export policy, source evidence, and idempotency key, then records either an accepted `recalculation_triggered` entry or a rejected worker mutation/request Log entry.

Triggers may be batched when they share the same Calendar or Plan scope and no member requires a user-visible immediate repair before the batch window closes. Batching should preserve the individual source references and reasons in the logged payload. A short event-loop batch is acceptable for multiple imported GitHub events, worker updates, or low-priority stale markers.

Immediate recalculation is required when the trigger can change the current or next recommended Task, hard feasibility, Task lifecycle state, dependency or precondition truth, Objective status, affect legitimacy, worker assignment needed for current work, or compact Calendar coverage below the configured minimum. The default Phase 1 immediate triggers are `task_completed`, `task_failed`, `task_moot`, `user_override`, planner-relevant `observed_snapshot`, planner-relevant `external_event`, planner-relevant `github_update`, `low_compact_calendar_coverage`, and accepted urgent `worker_request`.

Stale marking is sufficient when the trigger only means cached Plans, Calendars, explanations, or reports should be refreshed before later reliance. The default stale-only triggers are `calendar_preview_due`, `log_review_due`, `discovery_mode_reconciliation_due`, `elapsed_time` outside the reactive repair envelope, `affect_confidence_decay` that has not yet crossed a configured planning threshold or current affect constraint, and low-priority external or GitHub observations that do not affect the current Plan.

`elapsed_time` should not create one Log entry per clock tick. It is materialized only when crossing a modeled boundary such as Task start/end, static commitment proximity, review due time, stale-affect threshold, reactive horizon expiry, offline precompute boundary, or compact Calendar expiration.

## 29. Current Major Open Questions

Unresolved questions are tracked in [`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md).

## 30. Design Process

The GitHub repository is the canonical public design process for UbU.

Chat discussions and private notes may generate proposals, but accepted decisions become official only when reflected in this repository.

Design changes should be recorded as:

- updates to `DESIGN.md`,
- accepted decisions in `DECISIONS.md`,
- unresolved issues in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`,
- or GitHub Issues linked from `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

The project should prefer explicit decisions over hidden assumptions.


### Current strategic posture

UbU has moved from pure design preparation into active pre-MVP dogfooding.

The project should now prioritize:

- visible `model-committee` dogfooding output;
- recruitment of a small core cohort of serious, self-directed contributors;
- prototype-funder discovery among privacy-sensitive independent knowledge workers;
- conversion of outreach into concrete next actions;
- implementation of trunk features needed by the personal self-governance product.

Further broad philosophical elaboration should generally be subordinated to implementation, recruitment, dogfooding, or market discovery.

Public-facing materials should avoid implying that there is only one meaningful contributor role. They should welcome several serious contributors while still distinguishing committed work from passive interest.

Public materials should also avoid negative metaphors when criticizing planning systems that fail to model affect. Preferred terms include affect-blind, emotionally incomplete, human-incomplete, mechanistic planning, or affect-insensitive planning.

### Public recruitment language baseline

Public recruitment copy should say that UbU is looking for a small core cohort of serious, self-directed contributors who want to help build an inspectable, privacy-first planning kernel in public. It should make clear that several contributors are welcome, and that commitment means taking a bounded public path from concrete context to reviewed work, not competing for one privileged role.

Reusable public copy:

> UbU is looking for a small core cohort of serious, self-directed contributors. Good first contributions include workflow examples, design review, synthetic or redacted fixtures, parser or validation tests, model-committee artifact review, and narrow implementation-ready issues. If the work keeps the planning kernel inspectable, privacy-first, and useful for dogfooding, there is room for multiple contributors to earn bounded ownership over subsystems.

Public materials may name the staged roles already used by onboarding: workflow informant, design reviewer, fixture/test contributor, implementation contributor, and bounded module owner. Prototype-funder or design-partner leads may also be routed through outreach, but should not be presented as a privileged contributor rank.

Avoid language such as `the co-builder`, `highest-priority contact`, `one founding slot`, `competing for a role`, `exclusive inner circle`, `prove you belong`, `hand-picked elite`, or any phrasing that treats passive interest as worthless. Casual interest should be welcomed when it can become a workflow example, design feedback, contributor lead, prototype-funder lead, or public issue.

ETHConf and similar follow-up should route each person into one concrete next action: send a workflow example, review a model-committee artifact, comment on a public design question, contribute a fixture or test, take a narrow implementation-ready issue, introduce a serious contributor, or discuss a trunk-compatible prototype sponsorship.


### Release Outreach Pipeline baseline

Public and project-facing release communication should be treated as a first-class planning output. The standard tagline is:

> UbU should make every release explain itself.

For UbU itself, a minor release should normally produce a release outreach package when there is enough change to explain. The package should be grounded in current repository state, release notes, accepted decisions, closed issues, automated UI screenshots, scripted demo recordings, test fixtures, known limitations, and future-plan labels.

The public-audience script should explain what changed and why it matters without assuming deep computer knowledge. The developer-facing segment should briefly show dogfooding, current implementation artifacts, and concrete ways serious contributors can help. This lets a single release package serve users, nontechnical supporters, FOSS developers, project maintainers, design partners, and prototype funders.

Release outreach automation should draft and assemble artifacts before it publishes them. Human or policy approval is required before public upload, announcement, or mutation of external channels unless a project explicitly configures a narrow trusted auto-publication rule. Export must respect Compartment, Identity, and public-projection boundaries.

### First technical essay baseline

The first public technical essay should use `The Planning Kernel: What Task Managers Leave Out` as the working title. It should lead with a precise problem claim: list, calendar, board, and opaque assistant tools are useful projections, but they are not enough for real planning unless objectives, state transitions, dependencies, constraints, logs, uncertainty, affect, and recalculation are explicit.

The essay should avoid accusatory title language such as `your task manager is lying to you`, negative metaphors for affect-blind systems, generic startup brochure copy, grandiose inevitability claims, privacy overclaims, scarcity contributor framing, and claims that LLMs are the planner. It should explain LLMs as advisory tools that help interpret, summarize, propose, critique, and generate fixtures, while canonical planning remains inspectable and recalculable. It should point to `model-committee` as visible dogfooding and request one concrete planning-kernel workflow example that can become a public issue, fixture, interview, or prototype-funder conversation.

### Long-arc public narrative baseline

UbU may publicly say it is a long-running personal and technical project whose architecture predates the current LLM moment, and that recent LLM capabilities make the plan more practical by improving interpretation, summarization, proposal generation, fixture creation, and advisory automation.

Public copy should share only enough personal history to explain commitment, design maturity, and why the project exists. It should avoid memoir, destiny claims, and claims that UbU was inevitable. The preferred framing is: `I have worked on this problem for a long time; the toolchain is now good enough to build and test a narrow, inspectable version in public.`

Durable significance should be stated as a possibility to test through dogfooding, contributors, and prototype-funder discovery. Preferred language includes `could matter for a long time`, `worth building carefully`, and `a serious attempt at privacy-first self-governance software`. Avoid `will change the world`, `inevitable`, `once-in-a-generation`, `solves coordination`, `the future of work`, `the only real solution`, `world-historical`, and similar totalizing claims.

The narrative belongs mainly in the first technical essay, selected outreach, talks, and interviews. README-level use should be short and point back to current dogfooding and contribution paths, not long personal history.

### Contributor onboarding baseline

Committed-contributor onboarding should be public, bounded, and fixture-first. The minimum path is: read the project overview/core principles, model-committee dogfooding, Phase 1 demo, GitHub dogfooding, open-core, Compartment, and design-process sections; run the no-private-access local smoke command for the relevant repo; make a small public contribution; then earn broader ownership through reviewed work.

For `model-committee`, the first command should be `uv run model-committee doctor`, followed by a fake-provider or fixture-backed run/test when available. The first task should touch a synthetic or redacted fixture, parser or validation test, model-committee artifact review, public workflow example, or narrow implementation-ready issue with explicit acceptance criteria.

Contributors should understand the core boundaries before implementation: canonical state lives only in committed canonical files; model-committee is advisory; v0.1 provider/network and no-auto-apply boundaries are hard; GitHub is a projection; LLMs are advisory; Compartment and low-security rules constrain data routing; and the open-core planning kernel must remain inspectable and self-hostable.

Contributor progression runs from workflow informant to design reviewer to fixture/test contributor to implementation contributor to bounded module owner. Work that requires private project-owner context is not onboarding-ready; it should be converted into a public issue, fixture, design note, or open question with sensitive details redacted or synthesized.

### Commercial funding red lines

Funding is acceptable only when it accelerates trunk capabilities needed by the personal self-governance product and preserves the user's authority over objectives, logs, plans, affect data, compartments, and external projections.

Acceptable prototype funding may pay for planning-kernel, local-first, privacy, Compartment, affect-aware planning, GitHub/calendar/task ingestion, Log, risk-report, worker, or projection features that generalize to the open core.

Incompatible funding includes requests for:

- surveillance-style project management, activity scoring, keystroke or screen monitoring, or always-on productivity telemetry;
- manager-first dashboards that rank, pressure, or compare contributors instead of helping a person or project operator govern commitments explicitly;
- centralized productivity telemetry across users, teams, clients, or contributors without explicit user-controlled sharing;
- generic enterprise dashboards that make UbU a conventional reporting layer rather than a self-governance planner;
- features that expose affect, private relationship data, Compartment payloads, or low-security personal context to managers, funders, or customers as a condition of use;
- token-first, speculation-first, governance-token, DAO-dashboard, or financialized coordination work that would reposition UbU as a crypto product;
- custom branches whose value depends on one funder's private workflow and would not become trunk capability.

Funding terms are incompatible when they require:

- funder control over the product roadmap, canonical design process, licensing boundary, or accepted decisions;
- exclusive ownership, assignment, or proprietary relicensing of open-core planning-kernel work;
- a closed-source replacement for functionality that public contributors need for ordinary dogfooding;
- confidentiality terms that prevent honest public explanation of architectural constraints, privacy limits, or contributor-facing behavior;
- urgency, deliverables, or support obligations that materially displace Phase 1 implementation, recruitment, or public dogfooding.

Crypto, tokenization, or DAO-specific requests should be rejected when they are token-first or speculation-first, and deferred when they are merely integration-specific rather than needed for the personal self-governance trunk.

Paid work should fund trunk features by default. When a funded prototype needs customer-specific configuration, that configuration should remain outside the core boundary unless it exposes a reusable open-core abstraction.

### Prototype-funder workflow baseline

The first fundable independent-consultant prototype is a local commitment-risk and weekly-planning workflow, not a general inbox assistant or enterprise dashboard.

The prototype should answer one buyer question: whether the consultant is about to miss, overrun, or quietly under-service a client commitment this week, and what to do next without exposing private client content.

Minimum inputs are manual client/project declarations, manually entered or imported deadlines, task declarations, current availability, optional calendar busy/free blocks, optional GitHub issue/PR references, and an affect Snapshot. Email, notes, invoices, and full message bodies are excluded from the first prototype unless represented by user-approved structural references.

The primary output is a compartment-aware weekly commitment-risk review plus a next-day default Plan. It should show client/project compartments, deadlines, dependency and overcommitment risk, blocked or stale commitments, affect/energy constraints, and the exact structural data used. It should not expose one client's payload in another client's view.

The prototype remains on the trunk when every funded feature maps to reusable open-core objects: Objectives, Tasks, Logs, Compartments, Calendar/Plan generation, risk reports, optional GitHub/calendar ingestion, and user-visible import/projection boundaries. Customer-specific templates, connector credentials, private examples, and support may remain outside the core.

Prototype-funder discovery should test paid design-partner structures before custom consulting: a small prepaid discovery/review session, a larger prepaid prototype sponsorship, or a design-partner retainer whose deliverable is trunk functionality plus customer-specific configuration. Exact pricing is market-discovery data rather than canonical product policy, but offers that cannot fund reusable trunk work should be rejected or renegotiated.

### Open-core and FOSS boundary

UbU treats the planning kernel and contributor-facing integration surface as the open core. A public contributor must be able to inspect, run, modify, and self-host the core system needed for ordinary single-user and project dogfooding without depending on private replacement components.

The definitely open-source surface includes:

- canonical data model schemas and migrations for Objectives, Preferences, WorkItems, Tasks, Containers, UniverseState, Snapshots, Plans, Calendars, Logs, Identities, Relationships, Zones, Compartments, External Events, External References, Association-related schemas when implemented, worker assignments, mutation requests, and projection state;
- explicit planner and Calendar-generation logic required for Phase 1 dogfooding, including constraint evaluation, recalculation triggers, compact Calendar serialization needed for transport or analysis, and MVP risk-report generation;
- GitHub import, triage, projection, reconciliation, fixture/demo tooling, and the managed-label/comment/block formats used for FOSS collaboration;
- worker-mode runtime surfaces required for delegated work, including Identity/capability checks, assignment, status, mutation request, and audit/log contribution APIs;
- local-first storage and sync protocols when implemented;
- the Super Automation extension/API boundary needed for third-party workers, connectors, or local services.

Private or commercial code may exist only outside that core boundary. Acceptable private areas include hosted-service operations, managed cloud infrastructure, paid support/packaging, premium hosted worker capacity, enterprise administration/compliance layers, proprietary connectors to closed third-party systems, and short-lived experimental prototypes that are not required for the public dogfooding loop.

Private experiments must not become hidden mandatory dependencies for public contributors. If an experimental component becomes necessary for the advertised open-source workflow, UbU must either open it before relying on it publicly or explicitly narrow the public promise.

Implementation repositories should use OSI-approved licenses. The default license for core implementation repos is MPL-2.0 so modifications to core files remain shareable while integrations can be built without relicensing unrelated code. Stronger copyleft may be considered for network-hosted service code, and permissive licensing may be used for small examples, SDK stubs, or interoperability fixtures when that better serves adoption.

Contributor trust requires clear labeling of each repository or package as open core, private experiment, premium hosted service, or external connector. UbU should not recruit FOSS contributors around a capability that depends on an undisclosed private substitute for the open implementation.

### Canonical and derived project documents

For UbU design governance:

- `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` are canonical design inputs.
- `README.md`, `OUTREACH.md`, `PM_BRIEF.md`, `FUNDER_BRIEF.md`, `SOVEREIGN_COORDINATION.md`, and `ORG_INTROSPECTION_BRIEF.md` are derived public-facing projections.

Question-answering uses canonical files. Consistency checking includes derived files and patches them when they fall out of sync.

### Directive decisions

Direct project-owner directives may be appended to `DECISIONS.md` as accepted decisions.

Directive decisions are canonical once committed.

They may override provisional decisions, create new questions, close questions, split questions, or require consistency repairs.

The model-committee process must treat directive decisions as authoritative input during the next system-wide consistency check.
