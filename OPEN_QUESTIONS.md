## UBU-Q0002: GitHub Projection and Reconciliation

Status: Solved Priority: MVP blocker Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0003 Blocks: Phase 1 GitHub dogfooding Resolved by: UBU-D0159 Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

1. Which GitHub fields does UbU write?
   - labels
   - issue body blocks
   - comments
   - milestones
   - assignees
   - PR statuses
2. Should UbU write only clearly marked `ubu:` labels and managed blocks?
3. Which GitHub edits are treated as external events?
4. Can any GitHub edit override UbU state?
5. How does UbU detect missed GitHub updates?
   - polling
   - webhooks
   - manual sync
   - worker-driven reconciliation
6. What does the reconciliation report compare?
   - GitHub Issues vs UbU Objectives
   - GitHub labels vs `pipeline_state`
   - GitHub comments vs event log
   - PRs / CI runs vs External Events
7. Does drift create a report only, or also Tasks to repair drift?
8. Does GitHub reconciliation run in the main UbU instance or an Automation Worker?

### Current direction

UbU should write only clearly marked UbU-managed labels, comments, or blocks, and treat other GitHub edits as External Events.

### Resolution

Resolved. See UBU-D0159.

2. When is it appended to an existing Objective?
3. When is it merely logged?
4. When does it create a Task?
5. How are duplicate analysis Objectives detected?
6. Do analysis Objectives inherit value from parent Objectives?
7. Do analysis Objectives automatically become moot or completed after resolution?
8. How does UbU prevent its own management process from becoming too noisy?

Workers need a way to discover or receive work.

### Question

1. Does an organization-mode instance explicitly assign Tasks to workers?
2. Or do workers poll for Tasks matching their capabilities?
3. Can multiple workers observe the same Task?
4. Can multiple workers compete for the same Task?
5. What happens if a worker disappears mid-Task?
6. Is assignment itself logged?
7. Can workers reject assignments?
8. Can workers request clarification Tasks?
9. Can workers spawn child Tasks?

### Current MVP leaning

Explicit assignment is likely simplest.

### Resolution

Resolved. See UBU-D0158.

Automation Workers need a bounded way to submit changes back to canonical UbU state.

### Question

1. Does a worker submit:
   - event records,
   - mutation requests,
   - proposed patches,
   - or all three?
2. What fields are required?
   - worker Identity
   - authority source
   - target object
   - operation
   - expected prior version
   - new value
   - reason
   - evidence reference
   - timestamp
   - idempotency key
3. Are valid mutations applied immediately?
4. Are invalid mutation attempts logged?
5. Can mutation requests be batched atomically?
6. Can workers request creation of new Objectives or Tasks?
7. Are worker mutations reversible?
8. How does UbU prevent stale worker mutations from overwriting newer canonical state?

### Resolution

Automation Workers may interact with GitHub using access tokens.

### Question

1. Are GitHub tokens stored:
   - on the central UbU instance,
   - only on worker-mode instances,
   - or both?
2. Are tokens tied to:
   - bot accounts,
   - maintainer accounts,
   - individual contributor accounts?
3. Can tokens be scoped per repository?
4. Can tokens be scoped per Task?
5. Does the central UbU instance ever see the token?
6. Does UbU verify GitHub writes by re-reading GitHub?
7. What is the MVP security assumption?

### Current leaning

For MVP, workers may own their GitHub tokens. The canonical UbU instance stores external refs/results, not necessarily the token.

### Resolution

Unresolved.

## UBU-Q0016: Compact Calendar planner grammar and execution profile

Status: Solved Priority: MVP blocker Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Architecture Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0014, UBU-Q0015 Blocks: Phase 1 implementation Resolved by: UBU-D0151 Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

Compact Calendar support is important for recursive self-analysis, future sync/transport, and fast recalculation. The current direction is no longer a bare DFS grammar. The planner architecture begins with skeleton Plan generation, then legitimization, then candidate Plan expansion and validation, with reactive mobile stewardship around the selected Plan.

### Question

1. What is the minimum skeleton Plan representation?
   - Static Task placement
   - dependency DAG frontier
   - prerequisite roots
   - ordered prerequisite chains
   - initial UniverseState assumptions
   - unsatisfied dependency diagnostics
2. What does legitimization add?
   - affect constraints
   - recovery Tasks
   - transition buffers
   - sleep/food/rest requirements
   - setup/teardown time
   - context-switch limits
   - slack and fragility thresholds
3. What is the minimum candidate Plan representation after legitimization?
   - materialized Tasks
   - decision envelopes
   - Plan probability provenance
   - value score
   - legitimacy score or threshold result
   - explanation lineage
4. Which search methods are allowed in each execution profile?
   - greedy baseline
   - DFS-like candidate construction
   - BFS-like near-term branch construction
   - solver-backed exact validation
   - GPU-friendly candidate scoring/simulation
   - local repair recipes
5. How is Plan probability represented?
   - scalar probability
   - log probability
   - probability interval
   - provenance expression over probabilistic inputs
6. How does the implementation avoid naïve independence assumptions when probabilities are correlated?
7. Does Compact Calendar encode:
   - skeleton Plan metadata
   - legitimized skeleton baseline
   - ordering constraints
   - duration PDFs
   - success probabilities
   - external-event distributions
   - interruption distributions
   - affect constraints
   - decision envelopes
   - protected/flexible/disposable Task metadata
   - cached explanations
   - execution-mode metadata such as time delta, branch horizon, GPU/CPU resource limits, and privacy-routing limits
8. Which concrete Plans are stored?
   - the legitimized skeleton baseline
   - the default Plan
   - user-previewed Plans
   - risk-report Plans
   - debug/reproducibility Plans
   - high-probability near-term Plans within a horizon
9. Which Plans or repairs are reconstructed on demand?
10. How is coverage recalculated after time advances?
11. What is the minimum MVP implementation?

### Current direction

The planner should first create a skeleton Plan from Static Tasks and dependency DAGs, then legitimize that skeleton Plan into a minimally human-viable baseline. Candidate Plans are then generated, semi-legitimized or fully legitimized, validated, and compared. DFS-like search may be one candidate-construction strategy, but it is no longer the full conceptual foundation. BFS-like branch caching remains useful for near-term divergence, but mobile UX should also use decision envelopes, cached explanations, criticality metadata, last-legitimate-Plan repair, and conflict severity.

The ideal search may be NP-hard or otherwise combinatorially expensive, but finite Task instances, bounded time scope, configurable deltas, pruning, greedy baselines, GPU-friendly scoring/simulation, cached subplans, and adaptive execution modes should make practical approximations tractable.

### Resolution

Resolved. See UBU-D0151.

## UBU-Q0017: Compact Calendar Coverage and Regeneration

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0016 Blocks: Phase 1 implementation Resolved by: Unresolved Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

Coverage belongs to compact Calendar serialization.

### Question

1. Is coverage exact or estimated in MVP?
2. Does coverage include:
   - duration uncertainty
   - Task success/failure uncertainty
   - external-event uncertainty
   - Objective recurrence uncertainty
3. Does a compact Calendar store coverage value only, or also uncovered mass?
4. What is the default regeneration threshold?
5. Is the threshold global, device-specific, Calendar-specific, or all three?
6. Does low coverage create:
   - report only,
   - recalculation trigger,
   - Task,
   - worker assignment?

### Current direction

The provisional short-horizon branch coverage target is `0.99` probability mass. Coverage and regeneration thresholds may be device-specific, Calendar-specific, or execution-mode-specific. This is not final.

### Resolution

Unresolved.

Automation Workers may fail or produce failed child Tasks.

### Question

1. If a worker-created child Task fails, does UbU:
   - mutate the same Task,
   - create retry sibling,
   - mark failed then create replacement,
   - mark moot?
2. Is retry policy defined by:
   - Task
   - Objective
   - Worker
   - integration type
3. How are retry attempts logged?
4. How are repeated failures prevented from creating infinite loops?
5. Does a worker failure affect risk reports?

### Current leaning

Failed attempt + retry sibling is likely best for auditability.

### Resolution

Unresolved.

Automation Workers may create canonical child Tasks.

### Question

1. Is the outer Automation/Super Automation Task also the Container?
2. Or is a separate Container created under it?
3. Are child Tasks ordinary Dynamic Tasks?
4. Or are child Tasks a dedicated automation-step subtype?
5. If child Tasks are ordinary Dynamic Tasks, how is automation-specific metadata stored?
6. How are retries connected to the original child Task?

Broad pre-MVP design automation stops after the Phase 1 planning-kernel blockers are resolved. Future design questions may block Phase 1 only when they are required for a concrete implementation slice, an accepted hard invariant, a needed contract, or avoidance of an irreversible schema contradiction. New MVP blockers require a blocker certificate showing the blocked implementation object, failed acceptance criterion, unsafe fallback, minimum answer needed, and persistence impact.

### Question

What minimum files and fields must a model-committee run log preserve?

### Current direction

v0.1 uses the provisional filesystem log format defined in `UBU-D0064`. `UBU-D0160` accepts the v0.2 minimum: a manifest-indexed run directory preserving canonical input snapshots, schemas, prompts, raw provider artifacts, parsed structured outputs, candidate patches, validation results, score matrices, disagreement and quorum results, selected artifacts, review notes, commit-message suggestions, and operator-run artifact-publication instructions. The long-term format may evolve through schema migrations and later decisions, but the Phase 1 logging blocker is resolved.

### Question

How should the model-committee work phase represent, score, select, apply, and commit concrete changesets?

### Subquestions

1. What format should work proposals use?
2. What validation is required before work scoring?
3. May models score their own work?
4. What criteria should work scoring use?
5. When may a selected changeset be committed locally?
6. What files may be modified in v0.1?
7. How does the work phase generalize from design questions to code changes and bug fixes?
8. How should Codex CLI schema-constrained proposals fit into the work phase?
9. How should Ollama secondary proposals be included in Codex scoring?
10. What should happen when Codex scoring selects a mechanically invalid proposal?

### Current direction

The work phase should produce explicit patch-style changesets, score those changesets, select the best one when quorum is satisfied, and create reviewable artifacts. v0.1 uses Codex CLI as the primary schema-constrained work and scoring provider, with Ollama as secondary proposal providers. v0.2 adds Claude Code CLI as a schema-native frontier provider and requires cross-scoring: Codex scores Claude proposals and Claude scores Codex proposals. Self-scores may be diagnostic but do not count as quorum evidence. v0.2 writes or updates `selected.patch`, `commit_message.txt`, `review.md`, score-matrix artifacts, disagreement flags, and logs. Remote GitHub mutation, automatic patch application, automatic artifact push, and automatic PR creation remain out of scope.

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Process Auto-choice eligibility: Auto eligible Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0039 Blocks: model-committee prioritization accuracy Resolved by: UBU-D0068 Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should model-committee distinguish harmful question proliferation from valuable decomposition of hard questions into simpler, more automatable questions?

### Subquestions

1. How is unresolved design burden measured?
2. How is automation difficulty compared between an original question and its replacements?
3. When may a question be marked decomposed rather than solved?
4. What metadata should link replacement questions to the original question?
5. How should work scoring reward valid decomposition?
6. How should the stop rule account for decomposition that increases question count but lowers total difficulty?
7. When is dependency-reducing decomposition preferable to waiting for all dependencies to be answered?
8. How should the system score decompositions that produce at least one immediately answerable replacement question?
9. How should dependency simplification affect question ranking?
10. How should answerability be computed from dependency metadata?
11. When should a blocked question be selected for decomposition rather than skipped?
12. Should answerability be a hard gate or a weighted score?

### Current direction

Increasing the number of open questions is acceptable when a hard or blocked question is split into simpler, clearer, lower-risk, or more automatable questions. This is especially valuable when at least one replacement question has fewer dependencies, simpler dependencies, or no dependencies, allowing the system to make progress without waiting for the full original dependency chain.

Question selection should use answerability as the first gate. Ordinary work should only run on questions whose dependencies are resolved, absent, or handled in the same work item. Blocked questions may still be selected for decomposition if the decomposition is expected to produce replacement questions with fewer, simpler, or no dependencies.

### Resolution

Partially resolved by `UBU-D0068`; detailed scoring mechanics remain open.

## UBU-Q0051: Minimum preference-calibration examples for Phase 1 onboarding and review

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0050 Blocks: Phase 1 onboarding quality, Preference calibration, Calendar preview, Log review Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

What is the minimum useful set of preference-calibration examples for Phase 1 onboarding, Calendar preview, and Log review?

### Subquestions

1. Which common situations should UbU use to emotionally ground early Preference judgments?
2. How many examples are enough for Phase 1 without making onboarding burdensome?
3. Which answers become Preferences, Snapshots, Logs, Objective annotations, or noncanonical review notes?
4. How should examples avoid leading the user toward an assumed value model?
5. How should calibration examples distinguish urgent value, emotional cost, social pressure, recovery value, and long-term importance?
6. How should UbU revise or retire examples that repeatedly fail to help the user make accurate judgments?

### Current direction

Preference calibration is MVP important but not an MVP blocker. UbU should use examples of common emotional costs, rewards, and tradeoffs to help users make better Preference statements. Examples are grounding aids, not canonical Preferences, unless the user accepts or edits them into canonical entries.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0052: Discovery-mode action inference and override semantics

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0050 Blocks: Discovery mode, mobile sensor workflow, behavior reconciliation, habit-pattern inference Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

What is the minimum Phase 1 model for discovery mode, actual-action inference, and user override semantics?

### Subquestions

1. How does the user select discovery mode, pause it, exit it, and inspect what it collected?
2. Which mobile sensor, integration, quick-note, or app-state signals are acceptable Phase 1 discovery inputs?
3. How should UbU represent actual user action when it differs from the Calendar?
4. When does an override become a Log entry, Snapshot, Preference update, Task status change, Objective reconsideration, or unresolved review item?
5. What clarification prompt is required before treating repeated behavior as a habit pattern?
6. How should UbU reconcile undetailed or under-specified time periods without overclaiming certainty?
7. How should Discovery mode preserve user sovereignty and avoid covert surveillance semantics?

### Current direction

Discovery mode is a user-selectable workflow state available at any time, especially from the mobile app. It may gather evidence useful for later Log review and UbU-directed reconciliation, but inferred observations are not final truth until accepted, corrected, or otherwise handled according to user-visible rules.

### Resolution

### Question

How should social identity theory affect UbU's Identity model, role model, group-membership model, and mode-switching semantics?

### Subquestions

1. How should UbU distinguish Identity as external presentation, permission boundary, social role, self-concept, group membership, and mode-switching context?
2. How should group membership affect Objectives, Preferences, disclosure, trust, and coordination behavior?
3. How should UbU represent in-group and out-group effects without hard-coding stereotypes or paternalistic judgments?
4. How should social identity interact with Compartments, Relationships, and organization-mode planning?
5. Which parts are needed for Phase 3 multi-user coordination and which remain later research?

### Current direction

Identity is already central to UbU. Social identity theory may require richer group-membership, salience, and role-switching semantics, but its impact is post-MVP and must not block Phase 1 implementation.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

How should social choice theory affect UbU's model of collective decisions, organizational legitimacy, dissent, and exit?

### Subquestions

1. What collective decision procedures should UbU be able to represent?
2. How should UbU distinguish authority, consent, voting, delegation, consensus, veto, and exit rights?
3. How should collective Preferences or directives be aggregated without pretending they are one person's Preferences?
4. How should UbU preserve dissent, minority reports, or unresolved disagreement?
5. What minimum governance semantics are required for Phase 3 multi-user / Identity coordination?
6. Which social-choice impossibility or legitimacy problems should UbU surface rather than hide?

### Current direction

Social choice theory is post-MVP. UbU should eventually model collective decision legitimacy explicitly for organizations and multi-user coordination, but Phase 1 should remain single-user dogfooding.

### Resolution

### Question

How should game theory affect UbU's model of strategic interaction, counterparty incentives, commitments, and adversarial or cooperative behavior?

### Subquestions

1. Which strategic patterns can be represented through External Events and Techniques?
2. Which patterns require explicit strategic-interaction objects or counterparty models?
3. How should UbU represent credible commitments, signaling, free-riding, principal-agent problems, bargaining, and trust-but-verify workflows?
4. How should strategic reasoning interact with Identity, capability grants, Compartments, and external projections?
5. How should UbU avoid overconfident game-theoretic recommendations when the counterparty model is speculative?
6. Which strategic-interaction features are useful for FOSS coordination, skilled contributors, grants, issue triage, bug bounties, and future Skill Barter systems?

### Current direction

Many strategic patterns can be represented through External Events and reusable Techniques. Deeper counterparty modeling and strategic-interaction primitives are post-MVP research areas and should not block Phase 1.

### Resolution

## UBU-Q0057: Evergreen Dynamic Task and gap-filling semantics

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0016 Blocks: Gap filling before Static Tasks, mobile next-action UX, Calendar preview quality Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU represent evergreen Dynamic Tasks or evergreen Objective-maintenance Tasks that can fill spare time when all predetermined Tasks before the next Static Task are complete, blocked, moot, or unsuitable?

### Subquestions

1. Are evergreen gap-fillers a Task subtype, a Task property, an Objective-maintenance pattern, a Technique-instantiation rule, or planner behavior?
2. What fields are required?
   - flexible start time
   - flexible duration
   - minimum useful duration
   - maximum useful duration
   - location invariance or broad location category
   - required materials or device state
   - affect suitability
   - cooldown/frequency limit
   - Objective link
   - recurrence/reactivation rule
3. How should UbU choose among evergreen candidates such as meditation, Calendar preview, Log review, lightweight cleanup, reflection, review queues, or relationship-maintenance prompts?
4. How should evergreen Tasks avoid becoming filler that crowds out recovery, transition time, or user autonomy?
5. How should the reactive branch layer consider evergreen Tasks when early completion creates a gap before the next Static Task?
6. Which evergreen semantics are necessary for Phase 1 and which can wait?

### Current direction

The planner should not leave the user with unexplained idle gaps merely because all predetermined Dynamic Tasks before a Static Task are complete. UbU should be able to suggest or schedule useful evergreen Dynamic Tasks when constraints allow, but the exact representation remains open.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0058: Adaptive planning granularity and offline precomputation policy

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Architecture Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0016 Blocks: Mobile-only planning, offline mode, low-power mode, Compact Calendar runtime policy Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU choose, switch, and explain Compact Calendar time delta, branch horizon, and branch coverage settings across full-detail, mobile, low-power, and offline execution modes?

### Subquestions

1. Should default deltas be exactly one minute, five minutes, and fifteen minutes, or configurable presets?
2. What user-visible explanation is required when UbU switches to a coarser delta?
3. Which triggers cause dynamic execution-mode switching?
   - low battery
   - thermal throttling
   - offline state
   - expected offline window
   - heavy workload
   - user setting
   - missing external worker
4. How much precomputation should UbU run before a known offline window?
5. How should cached plans expire after the user's actual behavior diverges from the precomputed branch?
6. What is the minimum mobile-only guarantee for preserving the core UbU experience?

### Current direction

Provisional defaults are one-minute full-detail delta, five-minute moderate mobile delta, fifteen-minute low-power/offline delta, one-hour reactive horizon, and `0.99` short-horizon branch coverage target. Mobile-only UbU must preserve the core experience, but may use coarser granularity, shallower branch coverage, reduced analysis depth, and fewer LLM-assisted features.

### Question

How should UbU define the trust, privacy, capability, API, and disclosure boundary for execution backends beyond the current local instance?

### Subquestions

1. What is the minimum Phase 2 personal worker protocol for a user-owned laptop, desktop, or server?
2. How should the planner route work among mobile, local desktop/laptop, personal worker, corporate cloud, and third-party provider backends?
3. What Compartment rules, PII stripping, encryption, redaction, and provenance are required before any external backend receives work?
4. What must be open-core so FOSS contributors can inspect, run, modify, and self-host the planning loop without a hidden service?
5. How should third-party UbU-compatible providers interoperate without being privileged over local execution?
6. Should dedicated personal worker appliances be treated as commercial packaging, reference hardware, or future product work?
7. How should future practical FHE-backed or comparable encrypted compute be prioritized if it becomes viable?
8. Should idle compute monetization be an external API-enabled user choice rather than an UbU corporate marketplace?

### Current direction

Cloud or external compute may improve performance, granularity, and analysis depth, but must not be a hidden mandatory dependency for the open-core planning loop. User-owned worker devices are Phase 2. Dedicated appliances, corporate cloud, third-party providers, compute monetization, and FHE/private encrypted compute are future commercial or strategic-research directions.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

What is the minimum provider-neutral LLM routing model that supports local Ollama, user-configured BYOK cloud APIs, optional UbUCorp managed inference, user-owned remote workers, and future compatible providers while preserving Compartment policy and user sovereignty?

### Subquestions

1. What interface should normalize local and cloud model providers?
2. What provider metadata is required for location, cost, context window, capability, retention/disclosure profile, and safety behavior?
3. How should Compartment policy prevent `no_cloud_llm` or `no_external_export` payloads from crossing a provider boundary?
4. What context-minimization, redaction, and provenance fields are required before cloud routing?
5. How should BYOK mode store and scope provider credentials?
6. How should UbUCorp managed inference be represented without becoming a mandatory dependency of the open core?
7. What user-visible disclosure is required before a workflow uses a cloud LLM?

### Current direction

Cloud LLMs are optional execution providers, not the canonical planner. The FOSS core should remain local-capable, provider-neutral, BYOK-capable, and self-hostable. Cloud routing must be policy-governed, explicit, and advisory.

### Resolution

Resolved. See UBU-D0157.

### Question

Should UbU introduce a first-class Association object, and if so what minimum fields describe an Identity-scoped perceived coordination structure without pretending that membership, authority, or boundaries are globally objective?

### Subquestions

1. What distinguishes an Association from an Organization Identity, Relationship, or External Reference?
2. Can an Association exist entirely inside one user's `user_mode` model?
3. What minimum fields describe perceived members, roles, shared Objectives, commitments, lifecycle, norms, confidence, and disclosure policy?
4. How should UbU represent informal groups such as friend groups, parties, amateur leagues, FOSS projects, conference cohorts, and skill networks?
5. How does an Association become formal enough to justify `organization_mode`?
6. How are invitations, exits, revocations, dormancy, and dissolution represented?
7. Which parts are required for Phase 3, and which remain later research?

### Current direction

An Association is an Identity-scoped, perspective-bound model of emergent coordination. Legal entities and institutional records are External References or evidence, not the whole Association.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

How should UbU represent claims about Associations as attestations with provenance, confidence, disclosure policy, review status, and dispute or supersession semantics?

### Subquestions

1. What claim types are required: membership, non-membership, role, authority, commitment, objective, norm, governance rule, capability, reputation, relationship, priority, and dissolution?
2. What is the difference between a user-authored attestation, imported attestation, worker-generated candidate, and LLM-generated candidate?
3. What provenance is required for generated attestations: source locator, excerpt hash, timestamp range, model/prompt metadata, parser version, and Compartment?
4. How should an affected Identity or Association dispute, annotate, accept, reject, or supersede an attestation?
5. How should trust weights or confidence differ between public records, legal filings, signed descriptors, chat logs, meeting notes, and LLM interpretations?
6. How should private or permissioned attestations avoid leaking membership, role, or relationship facts?

### Current direction

LLM-generated AssociationAttestations are candidate claims. They must be reviewable, evidence-backed, confidence-scored, and never treated as authoritative social truth merely because they came from a large corpus.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

What is the minimum useful Phase 1 workflow for dogfooding organizational introspection on the UbU project itself without implementing full Association automation?

### Subquestions

1. Which UbU artifacts should be used as evidence: design files, open questions, decisions, issue fixtures, outreach notes, follow-up Tasks, and public retrospectives?
2. What structured output should be generated: candidate AssociationAttestations, mission-alignment questions, priority-drift observations, follow-up Tasks, and redacted retrospective notes?
3. How should UbU ask whether its actual outreach behavior proves commitment to its stated goals?
4. Which parts can be manual or fixture-backed in Phase 1?
5. How should public artifacts avoid exposing private notes or contact details?
6. What acceptance criteria show that UbU successfully applied organizational introspection to itself?

### Current direction

Phase 1 should use EthConf outreach and UbU project records as a manually structured dogfooding case. The result should be an evidence-backed retrospective and follow-up plan, not an automated surveillance system.

### Question

How should UbU represent a SharedAssociationDescriptor as a signed or reviewable shared artifact without turning it into a false global truth object?

### Subquestions

1. What fields belong in a descriptor: label, purpose, declared mission, public references, governance rules, participation criteria, disclosure policy, contribution paths, and signatures?
2. How should descriptors be versioned, superseded, forked, or disputed?
3. How should multiple Identities indicate acceptance, partial acceptance, rejection, or interpretation of a descriptor?
4. How should organizational introspection compare actual behavior to declared descriptors?
5. How should legal entity records and public registry references be linked as External References?
6. How should descriptors avoid implying that all affected members consented or that membership is objectively settled?

### Current direction

A SharedAssociationDescriptor is a coordination artifact. Multiple Identities may reference or sign it, but each UbU instance still maintains perspective-bound Association models and attestations.

### Resolution

### Question

How should UbU model the Skill Barter marketplace as a future specialization of Association coordination and the Delegation Substrate without becoming token-first, speculation-first, platform-custodial, exploitative, or illicit-market infrastructure?

### Subquestions

1. What primitives are required: pseudonymous Identity, capability claims, reputation attestations, scoped work agreements, bonds, escrow-like commitments, dispute workflows, and settlement references?
2. Which payment rails can be represented as External References without UbU becoming a custodian or money transmitter?
3. How should privacy-preserving settlement options be described without implying sanctions evasion, tax evasion, illicit services, or unlawful use?
4. How should UbU distinguish skill barter, paid work, grants, bug bounties, volunteer passion-project work, human executors, agentic executors, and General Contractor coordination?
5. What public language must outreach avoid?
6. What lawful-use and safety boundaries are required before implementation?

### Current direction

The Skill Barter marketplace is a future cypherpunk/privacy-builder recruiting hook and product direction. It is a specialization of Association modeling and the Delegation Substrate, not the root concept and not a Phase 1 marketplace commitment. MVP-relevant work should focus on Delegation Substrate primitives that can later support Skill Barter.

### Question

What is the minimum Message Context Envelope schema required for Phase 3 cross-user communication to support useful priority, interrupt, Task, Objective, and response triage without leaking excessive private context?

### Subquestions

1. Which fields are required for Phase 3: sender Identity, receiver Identity, source system, raw body, message kind, topic, priority, interrupt recommendation, response expectation, deadline, assumptions, ambiguities, provenance, confidence, disclosure policy, and Compartment?
2. Which fields may reference local-only objects without disclosing hidden identifiers or private Objective/Task details?
3. How should the sender specify whether the receiver may treat the message as a Task, status update, blocker, commitment, or FYI?
4. How should a receiver's UbU convert envelope metadata into Calendar interruption, communication review, or Task-creation suggestions?
5. What provenance and confidence markings are required when metadata is inferred rather than explicitly provided?
6. What minimum user controls prevent accidental disclosure of Relationship, Association, Objective, or Compartment state?

### Current direction

Phase 3 should include a small context-rich messaging envelope as a premier feature. The first useful version should prioritize message kind, topic, priority, interrupt recommendation, response expectation, assumptions, ambiguities, and provenance over deep relationship reconstruction.

How should UbU integrate with legacy messaging systems so a flat external message can be locally interpreted by one UbU instance, and upgraded into UbU-native contextual messaging when both sender and receiver use UbU?

### Subquestions

1. Which legacy systems should be represented first as examples: WhatsApp, SMS, email, Discord, IRC, Slack, Matrix, or other systems?
2. What transport patterns are acceptable: side channel, attachment, linkable External Reference, embedded metadata, shared relay, or explicit native UbU transport?
3. How should two UbU instances discover that both sides support richer contextual messaging without creating spam, surveillance, or platform-policy violations?
4. How should raw legacy messages remain human-readable while contextual envelopes remain machine-readable?
5. How should UbU handle one-sided use, where only the local user has UbU?
6. What consent, disclosure, and Compartment checks are mandatory before sending structured context to another user?
7. How should invitation flows encourage adoption without coercive or spammy viral loops?

### Current direction

UbU should define a stable internal message envelope first, then bind it to legacy transports through adapters. Legacy integration can become a value-led adoption path, but must preserve user consent, recipient respect, and privacy boundaries.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0068: Structured message extraction schema, validation, and model strategy

Status: Open Priority: Post-MVP Phase: Phase 3 Decision type: Architecture Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0066 Blocks: direct-message ingestion, group-chat ingestion, communication-to-Task conversion, Association evidence extraction Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU implement the Message Context Extractor that converts unstructured direct-message and group-chat text plus available metadata into strict UbU JSON candidate structures?

### Subquestions

1. What input bundle should the extractor receive: raw message, source system, channel type, channel purpose, sender, receiver, Identity mapping, Association mapping, timestamp, thread context, Relationship history, and Compartment policy?
2. What output schemas are required: message classification, candidate Task, Objective link, priority, interrupt recommendation, actionability, assumptions, ambiguities, response expectation, confidence, and provenance?
3. How should validators and repair loops handle malformed JSON, invalid enum values, missing required fields, and overconfident inferences?
4. How should UbU distinguish explicit facts, channel metadata, thread inference, Relationship inference, Association inference, model guesses, and user-confirmed corrections?
5. Which extractor outputs can be accepted automatically, and which require user review?
6. When should UbU consider fine-tuned, distilled, or adapter-trained extractor models instead of general LLMs with strict schemas?
7. What training data and correction logs are needed before custom extractor models become justified?

### Current direction

Start with schema-constrained general LLMs or local models plus validation, repair, confidence, and provenance. Specialized extractor models are attractive later for privacy, latency, cost, and reliability, but should follow schema stabilization and labeled examples.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0069: Personalized TTS, voice-profile descriptors, and anti-impersonation controls

Status: Open Priority: Post-MVP Phase: Post-MVP Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0066 Blocks: expressive asynchronous messaging, accessibility, voice-compressed communication Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU represent optional voice or pronunciation metadata so text messages can be rendered as sender-like speech without creating unacceptable biometric, deception, or impersonation risk?

### Subquestions

1. What is the difference between a pronunciation descriptor, a style descriptor, a local voice profile, and a transferable voice model?
2. Which forms should UbU allow to cross Identity, Device, Zone, Compartment, or user boundaries?
3. How should users opt in, revoke, rotate, or restrict voice descriptors?
4. What disclosure, watermarking, provenance, or UI indicators are required when speech is synthesized rather than actually recorded?
5. How should UbU prevent voice synthesis from being treated as authentication or proof that the sender literally spoke the words?
6. Are there narrow accessibility-first versions that could be implemented earlier without creating broad impersonation risk?

### Current direction

Voice descriptors are a promising post-MVP communication and accessibility feature. They should be consent-gated, compartmentalized, separated from authentication, and designed with anti-impersonation controls from the start.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0070: Skeleton Plan failure diagnostics and user clarification flow

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0014, UBU-Q0015, UBU-Q0016 Blocks: robust planning failure handling Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

When skeleton Plan generation fails, what exact diagnostic payload and user clarification flow should UbU produce?

### Subquestions

1. Which failure classes are required for MVP: missing starting state, impossible dependency, cyclic dependency, Static Task collision, insufficient Calendar window, unavailable resource, blocked External Event, or unknown precondition?
2. How should UbU explain the failed causal chain without overwhelming the user?
3. Which alternatives can UbU safely suggest: relax deadline, remove Task, add prerequisite, mark state already satisfied, choose alternate Technique, extend planning horizon, or ask for manual decision?
4. When should this become an immediate blocking prompt instead of a normal planning warning?

### Current direction

Skeleton Plan failure is a critical model-consistency failure. UbU should not proceed as if the Plan merely needs optimization. It should explain the cause and request clarification or a user choice.

### Resolution

Open.

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Process Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0016, UBU-Q0053 Blocks: realistic candidate Plan search Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How expensive is full legitimization, and what semi-legitimization heuristics are needed before full candidate validation?

### Subquestions

1. Which constraints belong to full legitimization versus cheap semi-legitimization?
2. Are affect budget, slack preservation, dependency fragility, user-mode compatibility, local repair, and legitimacy-delta estimates sufficient for MVP?
3. Is legitimacy binary, graded, or both?
4. How does the planner compare a high-value but brittle Plan against a lower-value but more humane Plan?
5. How are recuperative Tasks represented when they are required for Plan legitimacy rather than optional gap-filling?

### Current direction

The legitimized skeleton Plan is the baseline feasible Plan. If full legitimization is cheap, it can be used as a frequent validity oracle. If expensive, UbU needs approximate semi-legitimization before full validation of finalists.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0072: GPU-aware planner kernels and solver selection

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Process Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0016 Blocks: practical planner implementation, mobile/desktop/cloud execution profile Resolved by: UBU-D0166, UBU-D0167, UBU-D0168, UBU-D0169, UBU-D0170, UBU-D0171, UBU-D0172, UBU-D0173, UBU-D0174 Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

Which parts of UbU planning should use CPU-exact logic, and which parts should use GPU-friendly search, simulation, scoring, or learned-model inference?

### Subquestions

1. Which solver/library candidates should be evaluated for skeleton validation, finalist validation, contradiction diagnosis, and candidate optimization?
2. Which candidate expansion, stochastic simulation, affect scoring, and robustness scoring operations can be batched for GPU execution?
3. What are the mobile GPU targets for Android and iOS, and what CPU fallback is required?
4. What desktop/laptop GPU path is appropriate for power users?
5. What cloud GPU path is appropriate for premium wide-horizon planning?
6. How does UbU enforce the rule that GPU search may propose but exact/conservative validation must certify?

### Current direction

Subquestions 2, 4, and 6 are substantially resolved for Phase 1.

**Subquestion 2 (GPU-batchable operations):** The four Phase 1 GPU pipeline stages are `skeleton_sampling`, `affect_legitimacy_filter`, `value_scoring`, and `monte_carlo_rollout`. Their semantic stage boundaries are specified in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`. The `affect_legitimacy_filter` stage implements only sigmoid affect-constraint evaluation, not full UbU legitimization.

**Subquestion 4 (desktop/laptop GPU path):** Resolved for Phase 1. The performance target is a local desktop/laptop GPU backend using PyTorch and a typed pure-function call boundary. `MAX_PLANNING_TASKS = 256` is the Phase 1 planning window ceiling. A CPU reference path or fixture-backed deterministic path is also required for tests, CI, and contributors without GPU hardware. Future premium or wide-horizon tiers may raise the task ceiling by scalar configuration subject to memory, scenario-count, correlation-matrix, validation-cost, and backend performance limits; linear scaling is not assumed.

**Subquestion 6 (CPU certifies, GPU proposes):** Resolved. The GPU engine is advisory and writes no canonical state. Hard constraint certification, provenance validation, final Plan validity, and canonical Plan commit are CPU kernel responsibilities.

Subquestions 1 (solver library evaluation), 3 (mobile GPU targets), and 5 (cloud GPU path) remain open and are deferred beyond Phase 1.

### Resolution

Partially resolved. See `UBU-D0166`, `UBU-D0167`, `UBU-D0168`, `UBU-D0169`, `UBU-D0170`, `UBU-D0171`, `UBU-D0172`, `UBU-D0173`, `UBU-D0174`, and `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`. Subquestions 1, 3, and 5 remain open.

### Question

What compact Calendar metadata and local repair rules are required so mobile UbU can preserve legitimacy and next-action clarity without full global optimization?

### Subquestions

1. What is the exact schema for protected, flexible, and disposable Task criticality?
2. What is the MVP schema for decision envelopes?
3. What conflict severity levels are required?
4. What explanation fragments should be cached with each Task or Plan segment?
5. What simple repair recipes are required for late Task, skipped Task, fatigue report, approaching Static Task, and missing prerequisite?
6. How is the last legitimate Plan stored and compared with current reality?
7. When should mobile ask the user, silently repair, or wait for desktop/cloud refinement?

### Current direction

Mobile should be a real-time steward of Plan legitimacy, user agency, and next-action clarity. MVP should include Task criticality, last legitimate Plan storage, simple repair rules, conflict severity, cached explanations, next-best-action mode, and basic decision envelopes.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

How should UbU model user personality, current affect, and likely desired planning style as stochastic parameters without claiming false precision or reducing user sovereignty?

### Subquestions

1. What are the minimal user-mode categories: deep work, rest, socialization, autonomy, structure, switching, recovery?
2. How should current affect shift candidate Plan probabilities or legitimacy scores?
3. When should mood/affect changes be treated like External Event-like disruptions?
4. How should ex post Log review update these distributions?
5. How can the user explicitly choose to become more like a different preferred planning/personality pattern?
6. How does UbU avoid manipulative nudging or pseudo-therapeutic overreach?

### Current direction

Stochastic personality modeling is plausible, but not required for MVP. The MVP can use explicit user inputs, conservative defaults, and Log review prompts before learning deeper distributions.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

What is the smallest safe optional VoxPopuli demo that lets a user describe an unstructured planning problem in natural language and review the LLM-produced structured UbU candidate output?

### Subquestions

1. What input prompt should invite open-ended user speech without implying therapeutic authority or full life modeling?
2. Which candidate outputs are safe to show: Objectives, Tasks, constraints, Preferences, assumptions, ambiguities, and suggested follow-up questions?
3. How does the UI show that LLM output is candidate structure, not canonical state?
4. What should be excluded from the demo to avoid overclaiming Phase 1 capability?
5. When should this be skipped so it does not displace higher-priority EthConf deliverables?

### Current direction

VoxPopuli is an optional EthConf/public demonstration and populist hook. It is not a replacement for the narrow Phase 1 bootstrap interview and should only be implemented if cheap relative to higher-priority dogfooding, contributor, and funder work.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0076: Planning horizon, early-preparation bias, and short-horizon time discounting

Status: Open Priority: Research Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Process Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 0 Depends on: UBU-Q0016, UBU-Q0051 Blocks: detailed planning horizon policy, premium planning horizon design Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How far beyond the visible Calendar window should UbU look, when should prerequisite work be front-loaded, and when does time discounting become relevant to detailed planning?

### Subquestions

1. What is the default internal look-ahead for a one-day visible Calendar?
2. When should a dependency chain be scheduled early rather than just in time?
3. What makes a prerequisite chain fragile enough to justify early preparation?
4. Should one week be the default upper bound for detailed local planning?
5. Which longer-horizon plans belong to premium cloud, user-owned worker, or research modes?
6. When should explicit temporal-discounting Preferences override the short-horizon zero-discount assumption?

### Current direction

The internal planning horizon may exceed the visible Calendar window. Fragile prerequisites should be completed as early as reasonably viable within short detailed horizons to avoid forced stressful choices later. For operational windows of one day to roughly one week, time discounting may usually be treated as negligible unless user Preferences say otherwise.

### Resolution

### Question

What is the minimum schema for realtime interaction sessions and realtime-derived candidate updates?

### Subquestions

1. Should realtime sessions be represented as Tasks, Events, Logs, sensor streams, `InteractionSession` objects, or a hybrid?
2. What candidate update types are required: interruption, task progress, affect signal, external condition change, clarification question, Plan deviation, Log candidate, Task candidate, or AssociationAttestation candidate?
3. How should UbU distinguish elapsed time noticed by a model from planner-valid Task, Calendar, or Log semantics?
4. What provenance and confidence metadata is mandatory for audio/video/text-derived observations?
5. Which realtime features are local-only, cloud-optional, or prohibited under sensitive Compartments?

### Current direction

Realtime models are optional interaction backends. They emit candidate updates. The planner, Logs, Compartment policy, and user-review rules decide what becomes canonical.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

When may UbU interrupt, pause, escalate, or ask for clarification based on realtime or inferred conditions?

### Subquestions

1. What user-visible modes are required: off, text-only, voice session, discovery mode, meeting/logging mode, local-only mode, cloud-assisted mode?
2. What conditions justify interruption: imminent deadline failure, blocked Task, safety issue, unexpected external event, significant affect shift, or user-requested monitoring?
3. How should interruption policy avoid becoming surveillance, nagging, or emotional paternalism?
4. How should UbU record user overrides of interruptions and use them for future calibration?
5. What UI indicators must show active capture, routing, retention, and review status?

### Current direction

Realtime and discovery modes must be explicit and bounded. Interruption should preserve user sovereignty and Plan legitimacy rather than maximizing engagement or compliance.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

What is the minimum Delegation Substrate schema that prepares Tasks for delegation while also helping the user perform solo Tasks more clearly?

### Subquestions

1. Which fields belong directly on Task versus a separate `DelegationPacket`?
2. What executor types are needed: self, local agent, remote/cloud agent, tool, human Identity, Association, General Contractor, or external provider?
3. What authority, evidence, privacy, expected-output, review, deadline, and escalation fields are required?
4. How should a solo Task use the same structure as a self-reminder without implying actual handoff?
5. Which subset is required for Phase 1 GitHub dogfooding and Automation Worker assignments?

### Current direction

The MVP should implement Delegation Substrate primitives where they support dogfooding, self-reminder clarity, and worker assignment. The full Skill Barter marketplace is not Phase 1.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

How should UbU model a General Contractor who coordinates multiple human, agentic, tool, or Association executors toward an Objective?

### Subquestions

1. What authority can a General Contractor receive and subdelegate?
2. How are subordinate Tasks, executors, evidence, and status reports linked?
3. What review rights does the user or originating Association retain?
4. How are budget, privacy, Compartment, tool, and settlement constraints propagated?
5. How does UbU prevent a General Contractor from becoming an unbounded agentic authority?

### Current direction

General Contractor is a first-class delegated coordination role. It is not an ordinary executor field. Subdelegation requires explicit authority, provenance, evidence, and review semantics.

### Resolution

Open.

### Question

How should UbU present the Skill Barter marketplace as an EthConf/cypherpunk outreach hook and future marketplace direction without over-scoping the MVP or implying token-first speculation?

### Subquestions

1. What is the cleanest language for voluntary coordination, sovereign identity, privacy, open markets, FOSS contribution, and pseudonymous capability?
2. How can Skill Barter attract younger developers with drive and time for FOSS contribution?
3. How should the marketplace direction connect to FHE, ZK, private reputation, private commitments, secure compute, and Ethereum-compatible privacy infrastructure?
4. What claims must be avoided in public outreach?
5. What is the smallest credible demo or diagram that shows the future direction while leaving Phase 1 focused on Delegation Substrate primitives?

### Current direction

Skill Barter is a future marketplace direction and “cool factor” outreach lane. It should not become a Phase 1 public marketplace commitment.

### Question

How should UbU represent and govern context assembly for LLMs and agents, especially when long-context models can ingest large archives or repositories?

### Subquestions

1. What fields should a `ContextBundle` contain?
2. How should Compartments, Identities, Associations, retention policy, provider destination, and minimization rules be recorded?
3. When must the user approve a ContextBundle before routing it to a model?
4. How should UbU summarize context exposure after a run?
5. How should ContextBundles link to downstream candidate updates and Logs?

### Current direction

Context assembly is a privacy-relevant act. More context is not automatically better context.

### Resolution

### Question

How should UbU model computer-use agents and background processes that consume compute, credentials, money, privacy budget, or external authority without necessarily occupying user Calendar time?

### Subquestions

1. What fields belong in `AgentAction` versus `BackgroundProcess`?
2. How should triggers, recurrence, schedules, cost budgets, notification policy, and escalation be represented?
3. How should prompt-injection exposure be scored when agents consume webpages, messages, documents, or tool outputs?
4. What rollback or mitigation metadata is required for irreversible side effects?
5. Which background processes belong in the Calendar, and which should remain separate from user time blocking?

### Current direction

Computer-use and background agents are high-risk external actors. They require authority scopes, audit trails, rollback or mitigation paths, prompt-injection handling, and candidate-update semantics.

### Resolution

### Question

How should UbU evolve from Phase 1 one-next-Task focus into a state-transition cockpit without losing first-person legibility?

### Subquestions

1. What are the core state-transition screens: next Task, message reply, Log review, Plan repair, Delegation Substrate packet, agent action approval, AssociationAttestation review, organizational introspection, and projection publication?
2. How should candidate state differ visually from canonical state?
3. Where can generative UI be useful without becoming opaque or inconsistent?
4. What minimum cockpit elements should appear in Phase 1 explanations?
5. How should users inspect evidence, constraints, expected effects, authority, and rollback paths?

### Current direction

UbU should become a state-transition cockpit over time. Phase 1 remains the narrow one-next-Task proof.

### Question

How should UbU represent domain- and scope-tagged counterparty-perspective hypotheses without converting them into facts about the counterparty?

### Subquestions

1. What minimum fields belong on `counterpartyPerspectiveHypotheses`?
2. Which domains should be first-class: technical collaboration, emotional availability, professional boundary, money/value, authority, reciprocity, trust, intimacy, conflict style, or others?
3. How should hypothesis confidence, evidence refs, counterevidence refs, review status, and last-reviewed time be represented?
4. How should UbU detect internal tension in the user's hypothesis set without making claims about the counterparty's inner state?
5. When should a hypothesis be archived, superseded, or suppressed after rejection?

### Current direction

Use domain- and scope-tagged hypotheses. The attestation target is the user's hypothesis, not the counterparty's actual perspective.

### Question

How should user-declared Relationship scope and perspective be versioned over time, and how should declaration drift relate to observed scope drift?

### Subquestions

1. What fields belong in `ownDeclaredPerspectiveHistory`?
2. When does a new user declaration supersede an older declaration versus coexist with it?
3. How should scope drift be detected when user declarations, observed behavior, and affect history disagree?
4. How should a deliberate RelationshipScopeTransition be linked to declaration history?
5. How should UbU distinguish legitimate scope evolution from unnoticed scope creep?

### Current direction

Relationship declarations should be historical. A changed declaration is evidence and should not silently erase the prior model.

### Question

How should candidate, deferred, resurfaced, accepted, rejected, superseded, and archived extrospection findings behave?

### Subquestions

1. What state transitions are valid for an `ExtrospectionFinding`?
2. What model influence is prohibited before user review?
3. How should deferred findings resurface when new evidence accumulates?
4. What data should a rejected finding retain to suppress repeated bad framings?
5. How should accepted findings mutate Relationship state, if at all?

### Current direction

Unreviewed findings must not silently update durable state. Rejection is a first-class correction path, not merely dismissal.

What evidence thresholds justify candidate findings about scope drift, boundary pressure, reciprocity imbalance, trust miscalibration, or rumination without amplifying paranoia?

### Subquestions

1. What corpus size, evidence count, recency, and salience thresholds are required before proactive prompting?
2. How should UbU search for confirming evidence when surfacing disconfirming evidence?
3. How should evidence decay in salience without deleting legitimate history?
4. When should high-frequency review without model update trigger rumination concerns?
5. How should UbU present uncertainty and false-positive risk in extrospection advisories?

### Current direction

UbU should be humble about interpretation, not timid about evidence. Behavioral-risk findings are advisory by default.

### Resolution

Open.

Status: Open Priority: Post-MVP Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0050, UBU-Q0089 Blocks: affective assessment, extrospection, relationship review Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU represent reviewed, value-aligned discomfort in a Relationship, and when may new evidence reopen it?

### Subquestions

1. What fields belong in `userAcceptedDiscomfort`?
2. How should UbU distinguish harmful relationship patterns from uncomfortable but value-aligned growth, caregiving, mentorship, or duty?
3. What counts as sufficiently new evidence to reopen a previously accepted discomfort finding?
4. How should accepted discomfort interact with RelationshipScopeTransition Objectives?
5. How can UbU avoid repeatedly warning about discomfort the user has already reviewed?

### Current direction

Negative affect is not equivalent to dysfunction. UbU should separate AffectiveAssessment from normative and functional assessments.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0091: Relationship, multi-party Relationship, and Association boundary

Status: Open Priority: Post-MVP Phase: Phase 3 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0061, UBU-Q0086 Blocks: multi-party extrospection, Association modeling, group relationship review Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

When should a multi-party interaction be modeled as a Relationship, an Association, or both?

### Subquestions

1. When is the primary object interpersonal interaction with specific Identities?
2. When is the primary object emergent group behavior, shared mission, institutional action, or collective coordination?
3. How should dyadic findings coexist with lower-confidence group-level findings?
4. How should a Relationship and Association over the same people reference each other?
5. What evidence corpus limits apply when the user is not party to all inter-party dynamics?

### Current direction

Use Relationship for interpersonal interaction with specific Identities, Association for emergent coordination, and allow both to coexist over the same people.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0092: Typed Relationship evidence policies

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Security Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0028, UBU-Q0083 Blocks: extrospection evidence, Relationship evidence retention, compartment-aware review Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

What typed retention, redaction, and evidence-use policy enums are required for Relationship evidence?

### Subquestions

1. Which retention policies are needed: retain indefinitely, retain until Relationship closes, session-only, auto-delete after duration, retain summary only, or user review required?
2. Which redaction policies are needed: full text permitted, summary only, selector only, reference only, metadata only, or prohibited?
3. Which EvidenceUsePolicy values govern extrospection, introspection, AssociationAttestation, planning, export, and model training?
4. How should raw excerpts be displayed without becoming durable copied private text?
5. How should EvidenceRefs record Compartment, source, timestamp range, selector, generated summary, permission basis, and provenance?

### Current direction

Evidence policies must be typed and enforceable. Durable Relationship evidence should prefer references and summaries over copied private excerpts.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0093: Extrospection-to-introspection handoff

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0050, UBU-Q0088 Blocks: introspection UX, extrospection UX, relationship review Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

When should a relational finding be routed into introspection because the evidence primarily concerns the user's own behavior?

### Subquestions

1. How should UbU identify that the user is driving scope drift, boundary violation, reciprocity failure, or trust miscalibration?
2. Which extrospection findings create candidate introspection findings?
3. How should evidence be reused without violating Compartment or EvidenceUsePolicy boundaries?
4. How should UbU avoid turning extrospection into blame-shifting toward the counterparty?
5. How should the user reject or accept the introspection handoff?

### Current direction

Extrospection should remain self-governance. Findings primarily about user behavior should hand off to introspection.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0094: RelationshipScopeTransition model boundary and reverse references

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0026, UBU-Q0087 Blocks: RelationshipScopeTransition, Objective targeting, Relationship history Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should RelationshipScopeTransition remain an Objective target while preserving reverse references from Relationship history?

### Subquestions

1. What fields belong on `RelationshipScopeTransition` versus `Relationship`?
2. How should active, completed, abandoned, declined, and superseded transitions be referenced from Relationship?
3. How should a transition update `ownDeclaredPerspectiveHistory`?
4. How should transition-generated Logs and EvidenceRefs link back to the Objective?
5. Which parts are MVP hooks versus post-MVP full implementation?

### Current direction

RelationshipScopeTransition is a process target for Objectives. Relationship remains descriptive but keeps reverse references to transitions that affected it.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0095: Process success and outcome observations in RelationshipScopeTransition

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0094 Blocks: consent-dependent transitions, Objective status, graceful nonachievement Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU distinguish user-controlled process success from autonomous counterparty outcome observations?

### Subquestions

1. What `process_success_criteria` are valid for unilateral, exploratory, mutual, and retroactive clarification transitions?
2. What outcome observations should be enumerated: accepted, declined, ambiguous, insufficient evidence, no response, or others?
3. How should an Objective be terminal and process-successful when the desired mutual outcome is not achieved?
4. How should Objective status avoid treating refusal as user failure?
5. How should outcome observations update Relationship evidence and hypotheses?

### Current direction

Counterparty response is evidence, not user success or failure. Consent-dependent transitions can be process-successful even when declined.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0096: RelationshipScopeTransition type taxonomy and review gates

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0094 Blocks: transition planning, review checkpoints, RelationshipScopeTransition UX Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

What transition types are needed, and what default advisory review gates apply to each?

### Subquestions

1. Are `unilateral`, `exploratory`, `mutual`, and `retroactive_scope_clarification` sufficient?
2. Which pre-action reviews should be recommended by default for each transition type?
3. How should romantic, professional, dependency-heavy, or power-asymmetric cases adjust the recommendations?
4. Which advisory checks may the user configure as self-imposed required gates?
5. How should bypass decisions be logged and surfaced for introspection?

### Current direction

Transition gates should be default-on advisory safeguards unless structural boundaries, external constraints, or user-configured required gates apply.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0097: RelationshipScopeTransition step validation and counterparty autonomy

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Data model Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0095 Blocks: Technique generation, Step validation, autonomy-preserving relationship planning Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU validate that every Step in a RelationshipScopeTransition is anchored to user-controlled behavior rather than counterparty mental state?

### Subquestions

1. What completion criteria are malformed because they require counterparty feelings, decisions, or identity change?
2. How should `counterparty_autonomy_acknowledgment` be represented?
3. What counts as authentic refusal, and when does it terminate an exploratory transition Objective?
4. How should one clarification after ambiguity differ from a retry strategy?
5. How should future reopening after refusal require materially new evidence and a new Objective?

### Current direction

All actionable Steps and Tasks must be user-controlled. Counterparty autonomy and valid refusal are explicit model assumptions.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0098: Manipulation-prevention taxonomy and affect-knowledge firewall

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0097 Blocks: RelationshipScopeTransition Technique generation, extrospection safety, relationship safeguards Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

What typed prohibited-strategy taxonomy, affect-knowledge firewall, epistemic-transparency rule, and single-iteration policy are required for RelationshipScopeTransitions?

### Subquestions

1. Which prohibited strategy types are required for MVP hooks and post-MVP validation?
2. How should UbU distinguish authentic self-expression support from optimized disclosure or persuasion scripting?
3. How should extrospection-derived affect knowledge be allowed for harm avoidance but not persuasion timing?
4. What is the epistemic transparency requirement for Techniques?
5. How should advisory warnings express uncertainty and classifier fallibility?

### Current direction

Extrospection-derived affect knowledge may be used for harm avoidance, not persuasion optimization. Behavioral-risk checks are advisory by default.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0099: Power, vulnerability, pacing, and graceful nonachievement

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 2 Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0094, UBU-Q0098 Blocks: romantic transitions, professional transitions, dependency-heavy transitions, graceful failure UX Resolved by: None Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU model power asymmetry, vulnerability asymmetry, pacing constraints, cooling periods, and graceful nonachievement paths?

### Subquestions

1. What values belong in `power_asymmetry` and `power_asymmetry_basis`?
2. How should romantic vulnerability, financial dependence, employment authority, housing dependence, caregiving dependence, emotional dependence, social status, age, and platform power be represented?
3. When should power asymmetry make a transition delayed, require stronger advisory review, or require external review?
4. What pacing constraints are needed: minimum time between Steps, observation periods, cooling periods, evidence requirements, and maximum prompt frequency?
5. What belongs in a graceful nonachievement path: terminal state, model update options, introspection handoff, affective support, and delayed review?

### Current direction

The model should include power/vulnerability fields and pacing constraints. Desired mutual outcome nonachievement is not user failure.

### Resolution

Open.

## UBU-Q0100: Structural hard boundaries versus behavioral-risk safeguards

Status: Solved Priority: MVP blocker Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Governance Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: TBD Depends on: UBU-Q0028, UBU-Q0083 Blocks: safeguard policy, relationship safeguards, product integrity, user autonomy Resolved by: UBU-D0165 Last scored: Never Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should UbU distinguish structurally enforceable hard boundaries from fallible behavioral-risk safeguards, so that it preserves user autonomy without falsely claiming to prevent misuse or illegal behavior?

### Subquestions

1. Which boundaries are true product invariants: Compartment, privacy, authorization, EvidenceUsePolicy, export, provenance, audit, identity isolation, and integration authorization?
2. Which constraints come from external providers, platforms, app stores, or law rather than UbU's own philosophy?
3. Which behavioral-risk checks are too fallible to act as hard gates by default?
4. How should user-configured required gates be represented without confusing them with product hard boundaries?
5. How should documentation avoid implying that UbU reliably prevents behavioral misuse?

### Current direction

Hard boundaries should be structural or externally required. Behavioral-risk checks should generally be advisory by default.

### Resolution

Resolved. See UBU-D0165.

## UBU-Q0101: Advisory safeguard uncertainty, override, and introspection consequences

Status: Open Priority: MVP important Phase: Phase 1 Decision type: Product Auto-choice eligibility: Human approval required Importance score: TBD Automation-likelihood score: TBD Risk score: TBD Answerability score: 90 Depends on: UBU-Q0100 Blocks: safeguard UX, introspection, relationship-transition UX Resolved by: None Last scored: 2026-05-26 Scored from commit: None

### Question

How should advisory behavioral safeguards represent uncertainty, false-positive risk, user override, and introspection consequences without becoming paternalistic gates?

### Subquestions

1. How should UbU communicate classifier uncertainty and false-positive/false-negative risk?
2. What UI should allow review, revision, bypass-once, disablement, or user-configured required gates?
3. How should bypass decisions become candidate introspection evidence without becoming soft coercion?
4. How should safeguard disablement interact with declared values around respect, care, autonomy, safety, and trust?
5. When should repeated bypasses trigger review of the user's values or preferences?

### Current direction

Advisory safeguards should be default-on, user-aware, uncertainty-transparent, overrideable, and introspection-relevant when bypassed.

### Resolution

Open.
