# UbU Decisions

Status: Draft  
Purpose: Lightweight architectural and data-model decision log for the UbU project.

This file records accepted design decisions so they do not need to be rediscovered from chat history. It is not a full specification. Details belong in `DESIGN.md`; unresolved matters belong in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

---


## UBU-D0001: GitHub repository is canonical for public design

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §31

The public GitHub repository is the canonical public design process for UbU.

Private chats, notes, and external documents may generate proposals, but accepted decisions become official only when reflected in the repository.

---

## UBU-D0002: Start public design documentation with four Markdown files

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §31

The initial public design repo should remain simple and LLM-friendly.

Initial files:

- `README.md`
- `DESIGN.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`

---

## UBU-D0003: UbU is a privacy-first planning and coordination system

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §1

UbU is not merely a task list, calendar, or project-management dashboard.

UbU is a system for converting messy real-world inputs into explicit, inspectable, recalculable plans.

Inputs may include:

- Tasks
- calendar events
- messages
- external events
- user preferences
- physical state
- affective state

---

## UBU-D0004: User sovereignty is foundational

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.1

The user is the final authority over what the user wants and what occurred.

UbU may recommend, infer, estimate, warn, and automate, but it must not override user sovereignty.

---

## UBU-D0005: Distinguish logistical consistency from philosophical consistency

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.1

UbU distinguishes:

- **Logistical consistency:** hard consistency required by the data model and planner.
- **Philosophical consistency:** broader consistency between stated user goals and actual behavior.

Logistical contradictions must be rejected, repaired, or resolved. Philosophical inconsistencies may be logged and reported later.

**Example:**

A cyclic active preference relation is a logistical contradiction. Ignoring a message despite an Objective to communicate more with someone is a philosophical inconsistency.

---

## UBU-D0006: LLMs are bounded assistants, not the canonical decision engine

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.7

LLMs may assist UbU, but they are not the canonical real-time planner or decision engine.

LLMs may serve as:

- planning oracles,
- advisory systems,
- UI/screenshot interpreters,
- external workflow helpers,
- document interpreters,
- value-reflection assistants.

---

## UBU-D0007: Value is attached to Objectives

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §7

From a data-model perspective, value is anchored to Objectives.

Tasks may derive value from the Objectives they serve, but Tasks are not the canonical source of value.

---

## UBU-D0008: Preference is a first-class relation object

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §8.1

Objective value is derived from Preference objects.

MVP Preference fields:

- `objective_a`
- `objective_b`
- `order`
- `acquired_method`
- `acquired_date`
- `enabled`

`order` may represent:

- Objective A preferred to Objective B

---

## UBU-D0009: Ordinal rankings compile into pairwise Preferences

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §8.2

If the user provides an ordinal ranking, UbU compiles it immediately into pairwise Preference objects.

The original ordinal input may be retained in the log, but the canonical value model uses pairwise Preferences.

---

## UBU-D0010: Preference cycles are logistical consistency errors

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §8.4

Active cyclic Preferences are not allowed.

Example:

- A preferred to B
- B preferred to C
- C preferred to A

This is a logistical contradiction.

---

## UBU-D0011: Derived utils are transient computational artifacts

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §8.5

Numeric utility values may be derived from Preferences, but they are transient and volatile.

They may be cached on Objectives, but must be recalculated when needed.

---

## UBU-D0012: Default util spacing uses √2 per preference level

**Status:** Accepted as MVP default, subject to future revision → DESIGN.md §8.5

The default MVP util derivation assigns:

- `1.0` to the lowest preference level,
- each higher level multiplied by `√2`.

Indifferent Objectives are placed at the same level and receive equal util values.

---

## UBU-D0013: UbU has three mutually exclusive operating modes

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §5

Each UbU instance runs in exactly one mode:

- `user_mode`
- `organization_mode`
- `worker_mode`

The mode is chosen at initialization and cannot change afterward.

---

## UBU-D0014: User mode models intrinsic human affect

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §5.1

`user_mode` is the mode for an autonomous human user.

Only user mode models intrinsic human affect.

---

## UBU-D0015: Organization mode does not model intrinsic affect

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §5.2

`organization_mode` represents an organization/project planning instance, but an organization is not a human.

Organization mode does not model intrinsic affect.

---

## UBU-D0016: Worker mode is a special UbU mode for delegated work

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §5.3

`worker_mode` is a one-device or one-enclave UbU mode used by Automation Workers.

Worker mode may run as:

- a daemon/service,
- a local workstation process,
- a GPU-capable device,
- a thin cloud-control server,
- or another specialized execution environment.

---

## UBU-D0017: Automation Worker is the technical term; Super Automation is a UX/product pattern

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §25.1

An **Automation Worker** is the technical execution entity.

**Super Automation** is a product/UX pattern in which UbU abstracts away difficult external interaction by using local services, Automation Workers, APIs, screenshots, photos, or LLM processing.

---

## UBU-D0018: GitHub is a projection of UbU, not the source of truth

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27

For dogfooding, GitHub is treated as a low-dimensional projection of canonical UbU state.

UbU is the source of truth.

---

## UBU-D0019: GitHub projection requires reconciliation

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27.4

Missed GitHub updates are expected in MVP.

UbU should support a reconciliation report comparing GitHub state to UbU state.

---

## UBU-D0020: Objective status and pipeline state are separate

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27.2

`Objective.status` is the canonical UbU lifecycle status.

`pipeline_state` is a workflow/project-management status, such as a GitHub issue pipeline state.

---

## UBU-D0021: One GitHub object may map to many UbU objects and vice versa

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27.1

GitHub ↔ UbU association is many-to-many.

Examples:

- One GitHub Issue may map to many Objectives.
- One Objective may map to many GitHub Issues.
- PRs, comments, reviews, and CI runs may associate with Objectives or Tasks.

---

## UBU-D0022: Objective has minimal MVP fields

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §7.2

MVP Objective required fields:

- `objective_id`
- `title_or_description`
- `mode`
- `status`

MVP Objective optional fields:

- `notes`
- `tags`
- `linked_container_refs`

Derived/transient Objective data:

---

## UBU-D0023: Objective modes are one-time or evergreen

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §7.1

Objectives have mode:

- `one_time`
- `evergreen`

One-time Objectives complete once and do not reactivate.

Evergreen Objectives can become satisfied and later active again.

---

## UBU-D0024: Objective satisfaction is derived in MVP

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §7.3

Objective satisfaction is not stored directly on Objective in MVP.

It is inferred from:

- Task effects on UniverseState,
- observed Snapshots,
- user declarations,
- other modeled state.

---

## UBU-D0025: WorkItems include Tasks and Containers

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9.1

A WorkItem is the abstraction over work-like entities.

A WorkItem may be:

- Task
- Container
- future subtype

---

## UBU-D0026: Plans contain Tasks, not Containers

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.1

Plans contain an ordered array of Tasks.

Plans do not directly contain:

- Containers
- Objectives
- Techniques
- Recipes

---

## UBU-D0027: Static Tasks appear in Plans

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9.2

Static Tasks are included directly in Plans.

---

## UBU-D0028: MVP Task schedulability invariant

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9.3

A Task is schedulable in MVP if it has:

- stable ID
- Objective link
- duration or duration PDF
- active status
- title

Permitted:

- dependencies may be empty
- earliest-start may be absent
- due may be absent

---

## UBU-D0029: Task preconditions are deterministic UniverseState constraints in MVP

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §10.1

Task preconditions are deterministic constraints over UniverseState.

MVP preconditions support:

- equality checks
- membership checks
- absence checks
- simple AND/OR logic

Numeric comparisons are not in MVP.

---

## UBU-D0030: Task effects mutate UniverseState

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §10.2

A Task effect describes predicted mutation of UniverseState if the Task succeeds.

MVP effect object contains:

- scalar success probability
- mutation list

If success probability is `1` or `null`, the effect is assumed to occur when the Task completes.

If a Task fails, UniverseState is unchanged in MVP.

---

## UBU-D0031: Duration uncertainty and effect success probability are distinct

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §10.3

A Task may have:

- fixed duration or duration PDF,
- scalar success probability on the effect object.

These are separate.

---

## UBU-D0032: UniverseState is first-class

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §11

UniverseState is a first-class data object.

MVP UniverseState is a lightweight shell with loosely typed facts and events.

Core fields:

- `universe_state_id`
- `timestamp` or valid-at instant
- `facts`
- `numeric_values`
- `set_memberships`
- `event_markers`
- `source_summary`

---

## UBU-D0033: UniverseState uses lightweight free-form keys in MVP

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §11.2

MVP UniverseState keys are free-form strings.

Default keys should use a lightweight namespace convention, but enforcement is post-MVP.

Values may be text / JSON-like payloads.

---

## UBU-D0034: UniverseState mutation vocabulary

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §11.3

MVP mutations support:

- `set_fact`
- `clear_fact`
- `increment_numeric`
- `decrement_numeric`
- `add_membership`
- `remove_membership`
- `append_event_marker`

Exact mutation-item schema remains open.

---

## UBU-D0035: Snapshots are observed state updates

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §12

A Snapshot is an observed update to UniverseState.

User-declared and sensor-derived observations use the same object type.

MVP snapshot fields include:

- `snapshot_id`
- `timestamp`
- `source`
- values
- confidence

---

## UBU-D0036: Latest observed snapshot overrides simulation on conflict

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §12.1

MVP precedence rule:

- latest observed snapshot overrides simulation on conflicting fields;
- user-declared snapshots are treated as top-priority observations;
- confidence is stored but does not defeat explicit user declaration.

---

## UBU-D0037: Affect belongs to UniverseState in user mode

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §13

Affect is part of UniverseState in `user_mode`.

Affect is not intrinsic to organizations or machines.

---

## UBU-D0038: MVP affect dimensions

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §13.1

MVP affect dimensions:

- energy / tiredness
- stress level
- mood

Values are user-queryable.

Energy/tiredness and stress may be scored from `0.0` to `1.0`.

Mood is represented as:

- categorical trinary: `happy`, `sad`, `angry`
- intensity scalar from `0.0` to `1.0`

Interested/bored is independent and derived.

---

## UBU-D0039: Affect confidence decays by age in MVP

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §13.4

In MVP, affect confidence decreases over time due to staleness.

The threshold/frequency is an algorithm configuration setting.

---

## UBU-D0040: Affect collection is modeled through an evergreen Objective

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §13.5

UbU may include an evergreen Objective:

> Collect affect information relevant to important usage.

When affect data is missing or stale, the planning algorithm may create UI survey Tasks.

---

## UBU-D0041: External Events are instantaneous

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §14

An External Event is an instantaneous change in the universe.

External Events have no duration and may overlap Tasks.

They are not part of feasibility evaluation for an individual Plan in MVP.

---

## UBU-D0042: Calendar is a set of possible Plans

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.2

A Calendar is a set of possible Plans.

A Calendar has a default Plan.

The default Plan is a current best recommendation, not a user commitment.

---

## UBU-D0043: Compact Calendar coverage belongs to compact serialization

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.2

Coverage is a property of a compact Calendar representation, not of the abstract Calendar itself.

Coverage represents the probability mass of possible futures covered by the compact representation.

---

## UBU-D0044: Compact Calendar should prefer deterministic planner grammar over opaque PRNG seeds

**Status:** Provisional, refined by `UBU-D0108`, `UBU-D0123`, `UBU-D0124`, and `UBU-D0125` → DESIGN.md §16.3

A compact Calendar may not require PRNG seeds. Earlier design notes used deterministic DFS expansion as the candidate example. The current direction is broader: compact Calendar reconstruction should be based on deterministic, inspectable planner grammar and stored planning metadata, including skeleton Plan structure, legitimization state, candidate lineage, coverage, and repair metadata where appropriate.

DFS-like expansion may still be one implementation technique, but it is not the full architecture.

---

## UBU-D0045: Identity is the external-facing interaction surface

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §18

UbU interacts with outside agents through Identities.

A human may have multiple Identities.

Organizations and worker-mode instances are externally represented as Identities.

---

## UBU-D0046: Relationship is structured UniverseState data

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §22

A Relationship is structured UniverseState payload data representing the relationship between two Identities.

MVP Relationship data includes:

- two identity refs;
- one identity controlled by the user;
- user-stated affect state toward the other identity;
- inferred/speculated affect state of the other identity toward the user.

---

## UBU-D0047: Device means execution enclave

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §23.1

A Device is an execution enclave, not physical hardware.

Examples:

- OS profile
- container
- VM
- secure enclave

---

## UBU-D0048: Zone is a workspace-like instance context

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §23.2

A Zone is a workspace-like UbU context.

A Device belongs to exactly one Zone.

A Zone may have multiple Devices.

Zones maintain explicit allowlists/denylists of Compartments, defaulting to deny.

---

## UBU-D0049: Compartment is first-class

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §23.3

A Compartment is a first-class data containment object.

Compartments enforce hard invariants, such as:

- storage backend constraints
- device eligibility constraints
- identity disclosure constraints
- export/integration constraints
- retention constraints
- audit constraints

---

## UBU-D0050: Sensitive content is referenced, not embedded

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §23.4

If content is specific to a Compartment, a WorkItem should refer to it through a Compartment-scoped reference.

WorkItems must remain structurally usable without dereferencing sensitive content.

---

## UBU-D0051: Risk is reportable, not first-class in MVP

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §28

Risk is not a first-class object in MVP.

Risk is handled through reports derived from Calendar/Plan analysis.

Examples:

- P90 completion time
- critical path
- deadline miss probability
- affect constraint violation probability
- low coverage warning
- dependency fragility
- worker failure / bottleneck

---

## UBU-D0052: Moot is first-class terminal Task status

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9.5

`moot` is a terminal Task status.

It is functionally equivalent to completion for planning, but distinct for logging/reporting.

Moot requires a reason code.

Candidate reason codes remain open.

---

## UBU-D0053: GitHub managed state should be clearly marked

**Status:** Accepted as MVP direction → DESIGN.md §27.3

UbU should avoid fighting manual GitHub edits.

MVP direction:

> UbU writes only clearly marked UbU-managed labels, comments, or blocks, and treats other GitHub edits as external events.

---

## UBU-D0054: The Phase 1 MVP target is dogfooding

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4.1

The first MVP should help coordinate the UbU project itself.

Phase 1 focuses on single-user GitHub dogfooding before multi-device sync or multi-user coordination.

---

## UBU-D0055: Scope freeze is now a priority

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §31

The data-model discussion has reached the point of diminishing private returns.

Further unresolved questions should become public GitHub Issues when possible.

---

## UBU-D0056: File authority model for model-committee runs

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §31

The canonical source files for model-committee question-answering are:

- `DESIGN.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`

Derived public-facing projections of the canonical design state currently include:

- `README.md`
- `OUTREACH.md`
- `PM_BRIEF.md`
- `FUNDER_BRIEF.md`
- `SOVEREIGN_COORDINATION.md`

---

## UBU-D0057: Model-committee automation is advisory and repo-driven

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0058: Model-committee v0.1 is intentionally constrained

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0059: Model committee outputs are weighted by capability and observed reliability

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0060: Open questions are selected by answerability, automation-likelihood, importance, and risk

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0061: DECISIONS.md is a bounded decision-memory index

**Status:** Accepted

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0062: Model-committee is a bootstrap UbU dogfooding workload

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0063: Model-committee work is changeset-based

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.2

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0064: Model-committee v0.1 uses a provisional filesystem log format

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0065: Model-committee v0.1 uses provisional quorum and provider-failure rules

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Superseded by `UBU-D0150`. See `UBU-D0150` for the accepted model-committee architecture and constraints.

---

## UBU-D0066: Model-committee follows a prioritized recursive loop

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.3

The model-committee project should be developed as a bootstrap version of UbU’s future self-automation and dogfooding loop.

The loop has three prioritized modes:

1. system-wide consistency check,
2. question/problem prioritization selection,
3. work.

System-wide consistency checks have highest priority and should run after every merge, UbU directive change, LLM model update, or other state-changing event that could invalidate the project model.

Question/problem prioritization runs after consistency checks and selects the next work item by scoring answerability, automation-likelihood, importance, and risk.

Work is lowest priority and should normally run only after the current project state is coherent and the next work item has been selected.

---

## UBU-D0067: Directive decisions may be appended directly

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §31

The UbU project may receive direct project-owner directives that are appended to `DECISIONS.md` as accepted decisions without first passing through the ordinary model-committee question-answering loop.

These directive decisions are treated as canonical once committed to `DECISIONS.md`.

---

## UBU-D0068: Model-committee may decompose hard questions into easier questions

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.6

The model-committee process should not treat every increase in open-question count as a failure.

A work proposal may validly split, narrow, or restate a hard question into multiple simpler questions.

---

## UBU-D0069: Model-committee v0.1 uses Codex CLI as the primary model provider

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.1

`model-committee` v0.1 uses Codex CLI as the primary model provider for work proposal generation and work scoring.

The runtime calls `codex exec` with schema-constrained output. Prompts are passed through stdin. Final responses are written to JSON files. JSONL event streams and stderr are preserved in run logs.

Every runtime Codex call must pass `--skip-git-repo-check`.

`model-committee` does not pass deprecated `--disable web_search` flags. If web search must be disabled, that is handled through Codex configuration or profile state outside `model-committee`.

Codex must not directly modify repository files in v0.1. It produces JSON work proposals and score results. Patches are validated and selected by `model-committee`, then written as review artifacts.

---

## UBU-D0070: Model-committee v0.1 authority boundary is explicit

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.10

`model-committee` v0.1 has authority to produce derived analysis, candidate answers, candidate questions, readiness estimates, consistency reports, provider scores, candidate changesets, and review artifacts. It has no authority to create accepted design state without an ordinary committed change to the canonical repo.

Automated actions allowed in v0.1:

- reading canonical design files;
- parsing and scoring open questions;
- running consistency checks;
- generating Codex and Ollama work proposals;
- mechanically validating structured outputs and patches;
- invoking Codex CLI for required scoring;
- selecting a mechanically valid patch from valid proposals when Codex scoring succeeds;
- writing filesystem run logs and review artifacts.

Human review is required for:

- accepting answers, patches, or new questions into canonical design state;
- applying or committing patches to `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, or `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`;
- closing, decomposing, superseding, archiving, or reprioritizing questions in the canonical repo;
- treating readiness scores as scope-freeze, release, or implementation go/no-go decisions;
- changing provider weights, quorum rules, or provider/network boundaries.

Forbidden actions in v0.1:

- direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, GitHub, or arbitrary HTTP API calls;
- auto-merge, auto-push, automatic PR creation, or remote GitHub mutation;
- automatic patch application to canonical repo files;
- direct canonical-file edits by Codex CLI, Ollama, or any model provider;
- internal manual override that bypasses failed Codex scoring or patch validation;
- updating derived readiness signals in `README.md` or `OUTREACH.md`;
- treating model output as project-owner directives, canonical user value, or release commitment.

Provider outputs are weighted by configured trust weights and observed reliability metadata rather than raw vote count. Static configured weights are sufficient in v0.1. Adaptive reliability weighting is deferred.

Provider failures are logged as run events. Each failure should preserve the provider ID, model name when known, run phase, failure class, timeout or exit status when available, stderr or raw response artifact path when available, and whether the run still met quorum.

A valid v0.1 committee result requires at least one mechanically valid work proposal and a valid Codex score result. A Codex work proposal should be attempted before patch selection. Two or more valid work proposals are preferred but not required. Failed secondary providers do not invalidate the run when quorum is met.

Codex CLI has subprocess-provider authority only. It may produce schema-constrained proposal and scoring artifacts through `codex exec`, but those artifacts are non-canonical until validated, selected, reviewed by a human, and committed. Direct OpenAI API authority is zero in v0.1 because direct OpenAI API calls are forbidden.

---


## UBU-D0071: MVP Logs are append-only per-instance event records

**Status:** Accepted

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0031`.

MVP Logs use a shared append-only entry envelope with event-specific payloads. Required fields are `log_entry_id`, `schema_version`, `instance_id`, `recorded_at`, `effective_at`, `event_type`, `actor_identity_ref`, `recorded_by_device_ref`, `target_ref`, `result`, `event_payload`, and `provenance`. Optional fields include old/new values, reason, notes, confidence, related Plan references, external references, annotation/correction links, and idempotency keys.

MVP event types are `task_completed`, `task_failed`, `task_moot`, `external_event_observed`, `snapshot_observed`, `objective_transitioned`, `plan_realized`, `decision_recorded`, `recalculation_triggered`, worker mutation submission/application/rejection events, and Log annotation/correction events.

Log entries are immutable once written. An annotation or correction creates a new Log entry that points to the original entry; it does not modify or delete the original. Corrections supersede interpretation of the original entry for query views while preserving the historical record.

Canonical Logs are stored per UbU instance, with device references recorded on entries. Device-local queues may exist for transport and audit, especially in later multi-device sync. MVP retention is indefinite for canonical Logs; archival may move old entries to colder local storage while preserving queryability and integrity. Deletion or redaction is deferred except where required by Compartment retention invariants.

Automation Workers contribute to Logs through worker Identities by submitting events or mutation requests. The canonical instance validates authority and records applied or rejected worker contributions with provenance, confidence when available, evidence references when available, and idempotency keys.

**Consequences:**

- Logs can support audit, reconciliation, worker accountability, plan-vs-reality feedback, and correction without losing historical claims.
- Detailed event-specific payload schemas may be refined alongside Task, Snapshot, Objective transition, worker mutation, and recalculation-trigger schemas.
- Large-history search can rely on rebuildable indexes over the append-only Log rather than treating indexes as canonical state.

## UBU-D0072: Phase 1 public demo is an end-to-end GitHub dogfooding loop

**Status:** Accepted

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0030`.

The Phase 1 public demo must prove that UbU can coordinate UbU's own development in a single-user dogfooding loop. It should use real UbU GitHub issues, PR/review/CI events, and milestone context when possible; if live access is unsafe, unavailable, or non-reproducible, a frozen fixture captured from real UbU GitHub data may be used with fixture provenance shown.

The smallest persuasive demo imports a curated issue set, maps it to Objectives and schedulable Tasks, generates a Calendar with a default Plan, explains the chosen Plan, displays at least one risk report, respects a user-mode affect Snapshot or stale-affect collection Task, shows Automation Worker assignment/status for delegated analysis or GitHub projection work, and writes or previews clearly marked UbU-managed GitHub projection labels/comments/blocks.

Live GitHub mutation is not required in a public recording. A dry-run projection is acceptable if it uses the same projection payloads and validation path that would be written after human approval. The demo must not depend on Phase 2 multi-device sync, Phase 3 multi-user coordination, full RBAC, fully settled Compact Calendar planner grammar, or autonomous remote GitHub mutation.

**Consequences:**

- The demo bar is end-to-end behavior, not complete implementation of every unresolved Phase 1 design question.
- Remaining GitHub projection, worker authority, risk-reporting, affect, and Compact Calendar details may still be refined in their dedicated open questions.
- Public messaging should describe any fixture, dry-run, or human-approval boundary explicitly.

---


## UBU-D0073: Core UbU planning and contributor surfaces are open source

**Status:** Accepted

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0029`.

UbU uses an open-core strategy, but the open core must include the planning kernel and the contributor-facing integration surface. A public contributor must be able to inspect, run, modify, and self-host the core system needed for ordinary single-user and project dogfooding without depending on private replacement components.

The definitely open-source surface includes data model schemas and migrations; the explicit planner and Calendar-generation logic required for Phase 1 dogfooding; GitHub import, triage, projection, reconciliation, fixture/demo tooling, and managed-label/comment/block formats; worker-mode runtime surfaces required for delegated work; compact Calendar serialization needed for transport or analysis; local-first storage and sync protocols when implemented; and the Super Automation extension/API boundary needed for third-party workers, connectors, or local services.

Private or commercial code may exist outside that boundary. Acceptable private areas include hosted-service operations, managed cloud infrastructure, paid support and packaging, premium hosted worker capacity, enterprise administration or compliance layers, proprietary connectors to closed third-party systems, and short-lived experimental prototypes that are not required for the public dogfooding loop.

Private experiments must not become hidden mandatory dependencies for public contributors. If an experimental component becomes necessary for the advertised open-source workflow, UbU must either open it before relying on it publicly or explicitly narrow the public promise. Repositories and packages should be labeled as open core, private experiment, premium hosted service, or external connector so contributors can tell where their work fits.

Implementation repositories should use OSI-approved licenses. The default license for core implementation repos is MPL-2.0 so modifications to core files remain shareable while integrations can be built without relicensing unrelated code. Stronger copyleft may be considered for network-hosted service code, and permissive licensing may be used for small examples, SDK stubs, or interoperability fixtures when that better serves adoption. No contributor agreement should grant unilateral proprietary relicensing of core contributions unless a later accepted decision explicitly changes that rule.

**Consequences:**

- The commercial boundary is service, operations, premium capacity, enterprise layers, proprietary closed-system connectors, and private experiments, not a hidden replacement for the planning kernel.
- Public contributor messaging should avoid claims that require private components.
- Future implementation repos need license files and package labels consistent with this boundary.

## UBU-D0074: Phase 1 privacy promise is a minimal Compartment guardrail layer

**Status:** Accepted

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0028`.

Phase 1 implements Compartments as metadata-backed classification and routing guardrails, not as the full multi-device containment system intended for later phases. A Phase 1 Compartment can mark content as local-only, disallow cloud LLM routing, disallow external export, declare allowed integrations, and declare allowed Devices within the limits of the single local Device model.

The hard Phase 1 invariants are narrow: `no_cloud_llm` Compartment content must not be sent to cloud LLM routes; `no_external_export` Compartment content must not be exported, projected, or handed to workers except as redacted structural references; Compartment-marked content crosses boundaries only through an allowed route and user-visible action; and boundary-crossing attempts that reach UbU are recorded in Logs as allowed or denied. Sensitive Compartment content is referenced rather than embedded in ordinary WorkItem structure.

Phase 1 does not promise complete privacy isolation, cryptographic isolation, hardware attestation, secure multi-device partial replication, protection from a malicious local administrator, or automated retention deletion/redaction. Retention policies may be recorded, but enforcement beyond append-only Log retention is post-MVP unless a specific implementation later adds and discloses it.

Un-compartmented content is explicitly labeled `security_level: low`. Low-security content is not compartment-protected and may be routed to configured integrations or cloud LLM-backed Automation Workers only through a user-visible integration or worker action.

Phase 1 may claim local-first operation only in the limited sense that canonical planning state, Logs, and source-linked project model data live in the local single-user UbU instance by default. It must not claim local-only operation, Phase 2 sync, conflict handling, partial replication, or secure multi-device Compartment propagation. Phase 1 may claim cloud LLM usage is optional, explicit, integration-scoped, and advisory; cloud LLMs are not the canonical planner and must not receive `no_cloud_llm` Compartment content.

**Consequences:**

- Public messaging must distinguish privacy-first architecture from the narrower implemented Phase 1 privacy baseline.
- Full Compartment enforcement across sync, retention, device eligibility, and cryptographic isolation remains future work unless separately accepted and implemented.
- Implementations must label un-compartmented content as low-security rather than implying default protection.

## UBU-D0075: Organization and worker web admin UIs are post-MVP public surfaces

**Status:** Accepted

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0027`.

Organization-mode public UX is a project operations dashboard. The first screen should emphasize pipeline state, Plan/risk summaries, worker assignments and health, pending worker mutation requests, GitHub projection/reconciliation status, and recent decision/projection/worker Log entries requiring attention. It should avoid personal affect UX and should label admin-equivalent operation when full RBAC is absent.

Worker-mode public UX is an operator console for a worker instance. The first screen should emphasize connection and Identity status, service health and last check-in, active assignment and assignment queue, granted capability scopes, recent Log or mutation submissions, rejection/error state, and local resource status such as GPU availability or cloud compute state where applicable.

Both UIs may expose logs, queues, capability grants, resource status, pipeline state, risk reports, worker assignments, and GitHub projection status when the data is relevant to that mode. These views must default to summarized and redacted operational information and must not leak Compartment-protected payloads, broader planning state, or personal affect data through worker/admin convenience views.

No organization-mode or worker-mode web admin UI is required for Phase 1. Phase 1 requires only the single-user GitHub dogfooding surface and enough visible worker assignment/status information to satisfy the public demo criteria; that information may appear in the user-mode dogfooding UI, CLI output, or run artifacts.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0027` is resolved as a Post-MVP product direction rather than a Phase 1 implementation requirement.
- Phase 1 public UX scope remains focused on the single-user dogfooding loop.
- Future organization and worker admin UIs have a stable default first-screen direction without forcing RBAC or full admin products into MVP.
- Admin views must respect Compartment boundaries and mode boundaries.

## UBU-D0076: Relationship maintenance uses Objectives, history, and risk reports

**Status:** Accepted

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0026`.

In MVP, Relationship remains a structured UniverseState payload between two Identities and stores only the minimal relationship state already accepted: identity refs, the user-controlled Identity, user-stated affect toward the other Identity, and inferred/speculated affect of the other Identity where applicable.

Communication cadence belongs to an evergreen Objective recurrence/reactivation rule, not to the Relationship payload. Interaction evidence belongs in Logs, External Events, Task history, or Compartment/external references depending on source and sensitivity. Message bodies, private notes, or integration-specific history should remain behind Compartment or external-storage references when sensitive.

"Maintain relationship with contributor X" is modeled as an evergreen Objective linked indirectly to the contributor Relationship or relationship-relevant UniverseState key. That Objective can generate Dynamic Tasks such as reply, review, check in, or follow up. Task effects and imported External Events update ordinary UniverseState facts or event markers used to evaluate the Objective; they do not require a special Relationship-maintenance object in Phase 1.

Neglect risk is a risk-report finding derived from the Objective recurrence, observed interaction history, and current Plan/Calendar state. It is not stored on Relationship and does not make risk a first-class MVP object.

GitHub contributor interactions may update relationship-relevant modeled state when they are imported as External Events and associated with the user's GitHub Identity and the contributor Identity. They may satisfy or reactivate a relationship-maintenance Objective, but they must not overwrite user-stated private affect fields or infer sensitive relationship facts as canonical without user acceptance.

For Phase 1, relationship maintenance is supported only through existing Objective, Task, Log, External Event, UniverseState, Identity, Relationship, and risk-report mechanisms. A dedicated relationship-management UI, special cadence schema on Relationship, and full personal CRM behavior are deferred.

**Consequences:**

- Relationship payload stays small and privacy-sensitive.
- Communication cadence remains schedulable and recalculable through Objective recurrence.
- GitHub dogfooding can model contributor follow-up without adding a new relationship subsystem to MVP.
- Future richer relationship-management features can refine cadence evidence and private notes without changing the MVP anchor model.

## UBU-D0077: Model-committee v0.1 marks active pre-MVP dogfooding

**Status:** Accepted

`model-committee v0.1` marks a transition from pure design preparation into active pre-MVP dogfooding.

The project now has a runnable bootstrap artifact that can help process UbU design questions, generate reviewable changesets, and make the dogfooding loop visible.

This does not make `model-committee` the full UbU planner. It is a constrained bootstrap workload and advisory Automation Worker pattern.

**Consequences:**

- Public messaging should no longer imply that UbU is only an ideal design without runnable project machinery.
- The next strategic bottleneck is no longer the absence of a runnable skeleton.
- The next strategic bottlenecks are contributor conversion, visible dogfooding output, first-use workflow selection, and prototype-funder discovery.
- Further design writing should generally be subordinated to implementation, recruitment, dogfooding, or market discovery.
- `README.md` and `OUTREACH.md` should describe active pre-MVP dogfooding while preserving the canonical authority of `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

---

## UBU-D0078: Recruitment targets a small core cohort, not a single co-builder

**Status:** Accepted

UbU’s near-term recruitment goal is to attract a small core cohort of serious, self-directed contributors.

The project should avoid public language implying that there is only one meaningful contributor role or that interested developers are competing for a single privileged position.

Popularity is not the goal, but multiple committed builders could materially accelerate UbU toward sustained full-time development.

**Consequences:**

- Public outreach should welcome several serious contributors.
- Contributor language should emphasize self-direction, seriousness, alignment, and concrete work rather than scarcity.
- The project should prefer committed contributors who can own bounded subsystems over broad passive interest.
- Casual interest remains useful when it produces workflow examples, design feedback, contributor leads, or prototype-funder leads.
- Recruitment success should be measured by concrete follow-up, contributions, design review, prototype funding, or subsystem ownership rather than raw attention.

---

## UBU-D0079: Independent knowledge workers are the first commercial beachhead hypothesis

**Status:** Accepted

UbU will treat privacy-sensitive independent knowledge workers as a leading commercial beachhead hypothesis.

This includes independent technical consultants, freelance developers, security researchers, solo founders, independent academics, technical writers, and similar workers who manage complex multi-client work privately.

This market is compatible with UbU’s north-star vision because these users experience personal self-governance, confidentiality, dependency, deadline, attention, and affect constraints directly.

Prototype funding from this market is acceptable only when it funds trunk features needed by the full personal self-governance product.

**Consequences:**

- Commercial discovery should include interviews with independent knowledge workers, not only FOSS maintainers or Ethereum teams.
- Prototype-funder outreach should test whether these users would fund or prepay for concrete core functionality.
- Acceptable funded work includes the planning kernel, local-first data model, privacy/Compartment model, affect-aware planning, GitHub/calendar/task ingestion, Logs, and recalculable Plans.
- Funding that requires surveillance, generic enterprise dashboards, centralized productivity telemetry, or manager-first reporting is incompatible unless a later accepted decision changes the project boundary.
- This decision is a market hypothesis, not a commitment to abandon FOSS or personal self-governance.

---

## UBU-D0080: Ethereum and FOSS outreach are recruitment and validation channels

**Status:** Accepted

Ethereum, FOSS, protocol, and autonomous developer communities are valuable early outreach channels because they expose UbU to high-autonomy contributors, complex coordination failures, anti-surveillance norms, and developer-tooling expectations.

These communities are not necessarily the first commercial buyer market.

Their primary near-term role is recruitment, workflow discovery, dogfooding validation, contributor-sustainability research, and project-management pain discovery.

**Consequences:**

- ETHConf and similar events should be treated as discovery and recruitment opportunities, not as proof that UbU is primarily a crypto project.
- FOSS outreach should seek concrete workflow examples, contributor candidates, design partners, and maintainers willing to discuss real coordination failures.
- Ethereum/protocol outreach should avoid token-first positioning.
- Project-management positioning should remain subordinate to personal self-governance and contributor sovereignty.
- UbU should not chase generic crypto speculation communities.

---

## UBU-D0081: Affect-aware planning is a core humane-planning requirement

**Status:** Accepted

UbU treats affect-aware planning as a core requirement, not a secondary wellness feature.

Planning systems that ignore fatigue, stress, boredom, motivation, emotional load, recovery, and dignity can produce plans that are technically organized but humanly unrealistic or harmful.

UbU should provide fast feedback about plan success or failure, suggest improvement after failure, respect emotional and physical limits, and still help users grow beyond current limitations.

The goal is neither comfort-maximization nor coercive productivity. The goal is humane self-governance: disciplined action that respects the user’s emotional and physical reality.

**Consequences:**

- Affect belongs to the core planning model in `user_mode`.
- Plans should be evaluated not only for logistical feasibility but also for human realism.
- A plan that repeatedly fails due to affect, fatigue, stress, boredom, or overload should cause model revision rather than user-blaming.
- Risk reports should eventually identify affect-related plan fragility.
- Public messaging may describe conventional planning tools as affect-blind, emotionally incomplete, human-incomplete, or mechanistic.

---

## UBU-D0082: High-quality plans need feedback, dignity, limits, and growth pressure

**Status:** Accepted

A UbU plan is not high-quality merely because it is internally consistent or time-feasible.

A high-quality plan should:

- produce fast feedback about success or failure;
- make failure informative rather than humiliating;
- suggest revision after failure;
- respect the user’s dignity;
- respect emotional and physical limits;
- distinguish sustainable stretch from destructive pressure;
- help the user grow beyond current limitations when appropriate;
- remain recalculable when reality contradicts the model.

This invariant is especially important in `user_mode`, where affect belongs to UniverseState.

**Consequences:**

- Plan evaluation should eventually consider whether a plan supports learning, adaptation, and sustainable self-improvement.
- Failure should generally produce improved modeling, revised constraints, or new suggested actions rather than moralized blame.
- UbU should push users toward growth only within a humane and feedback-sensitive planning loop.
- A plan that leaves the user worse off despite achieving nominal task completion should be considered suspect.
- This decision should inform `DESIGN.md` planning-quality language and future UI/UX choices.

---

## UBU-D0083: Technical essay should present a problem-first planning-kernel thesis

**Status:** Accepted

UbU should publish a problem-first technical essay that explains the planning-kernel thesis without reducing UbU to a product brochure.

The essay should argue that ordinary task managers, calendars, project boards, and opaque AI assistants fail to model real work because they do not represent objectives, state transitions, dependencies, constraints, logs, uncertainty, affect, and human limitations explicitly.

The essay should emphasize that most existing planning tools are affect-blind. They model tasks, deadlines, statuses, and calendar blocks, but not the emotional and physical reality of the person who must execute the plan.

The essay should explain why LLMs are useful but advisory: they can interpret, summarize, propose, and critique, but canonical planning must remain explicit, inspectable, and recalculable.

The essay should point to `model-committee` as UbU’s first visible dogfooding loop and end with a concrete contribution, interview, or prototype-funder request.

**Consequences:**

- The essay should lead with the problem, not with a feature list.
- The essay should avoid generic startup marketing language.
- The essay should invite concrete next actions from developers, maintainers, autonomous-team leads, and prototype funders.
- `OUTREACH.md` may summarize the essay project, but the essay itself may live outside the canonical design files.

---

## UBU-D0084: Public narrative may use moderated long-arc framing

**Status:** Accepted

UbU may publicly describe its long intellectual development history and the fact that modern LLMs have made the project newly viable.

This narrative may be used to attract contributors who want to work on software with durable significance.

Public framing should remain grounded, humble, and specific. It should avoid unrealistic claims, inevitability claims, or overstated promises about changing the world.

**Consequences:**

- Outreach may describe UbU as a long-running personal and technical project whose time may now be arriving.
- The narrative may help explain why the project has a mature design before it has a mature product.
- The narrative should be used to communicate commitment and depth, not destiny or superiority.
- Contributor recruitment should connect the long arc to concrete present work.

---

## UBU-D0085: Avoid exclusionary and scarcity-implying public framing

**Status:** Accepted

UbU public materials should avoid language that unintentionally makes interested contributors feel unwelcome, replaceable, or in competition for a single meaningful role.

UbU should also avoid accusatory language when describing planning systems that fail to model affect.

Preferred terms include:

- affect-blind;
- emotionally incomplete;
- human-incomplete;
- mechanistic planning;
- machine-like planning;
- non-humane planning;
- affect-insensitive planning.

**Consequences:**

- Public recruitment language should refer to a small core cohort or several serious contributors rather than a single highest-priority co-builder slot.
- Public language may still distinguish between serious contributors and passive interest.
- The project may strongly criticize mechanistic planning systems without using negative metaphors.
- Derived public-facing files should be updated when they imply scarcity or exclusion.
- Canonical design files should remain precise and humane in how they discuss affect, dignity, limits, and growth.

---

## UBU-D0086: Public outreach should convert interest into concrete next actions

**Status:** Accepted

UbU should not treat popularity as achievement.

Public outreach is successful when it produces concrete next actions that accelerate the project toward a working self-governance product.

Concrete next actions include:

- code contributions;
- test fixtures;
- design review;
- workflow examples;
- maintainer interviews;
- prototype-funder conversations;
- implementation-ready issues;
- review of `model-committee` run artifacts;
- sustained subsystem ownership;
- credible paths toward full-time development of core features.

---

## UBU-D0087: Commercial funding must preserve self-governance

**Status:** Accepted

UbU may accept funding, consulting, sponsorship, prepayment, or commercial prototype work only when the work accelerates trunk capabilities needed by the personal self-governance product and preserves user sovereignty, contributor sovereignty, privacy, and the open-core boundary.

A funding offer is compatible when it pays for reusable core work such as the planning kernel, local-first data model, privacy and Compartment guardrails, affect-aware planning, GitHub/calendar/task ingestion, Logs, recalculable Plans, risk reports, worker assignment/status, projection/reconciliation, or other features that become ordinary trunk capability.

Incompatible requested features include:

- surveillance-style project management, activity scoring, keystroke or screen monitoring, or always-on productivity telemetry;
- manager-first dashboards that rank, pressure, compare, or discipline contributors instead of supporting explicit self-governance and project coordination;
- centralized productivity telemetry across users, teams, clients, or contributors without explicit user-controlled sharing;
- generic enterprise reporting dashboards that pull UbU away from the planning kernel and toward conventional management software;
- features that expose affect, relationship state, Compartment payloads, or low-security personal context to managers, funders, or customers as a condition of use;
- token-first, speculation-first, governance-token, DAO-dashboard, or financialized coordination work that would reposition UbU as a crypto product;
- bespoke custom branches whose value depends on one funder's private workflow and does not produce reusable trunk capability.

Incompatible funding terms include:

- funder veto or control over the roadmap, canonical design process, accepted decisions, licensing boundary, or contributor access;
- exclusive ownership, assignment, or unilateral proprietary relicensing of open-core work;
- private replacement components for functionality that public contributors need for ordinary dogfooding;
- confidentiality terms that prevent honest public explanation of architecture, privacy limits, funded influence, or contributor-facing behavior;
- required pivot away from personal self-governance, privacy-first architecture, or the open-core planning kernel.

Acceptable prototype funding must default to trunk-first implementation. Customer-specific configuration, connectors, hosting, packaging, support, or compliance work may remain commercial when it stays outside the open-core boundary and does not become required for public dogfooding.

Crypto, tokenization, and DAO-specific requests should be rejected when they are token-first or speculation-first. They should be deferred when they are merely integration-specific and not required for the personal self-governance trunk. Ethereum and FOSS communities remain useful for recruitment, validation, and workflow discovery, not as a reason to reposition UbU as a crypto product.

Paid work should be evaluated with a simple rule: if the funded deliverable would make the open personal self-governance trunk better for independent knowledge workers and future public dogfooding, it may be considered; if it creates a private branch, surveillance surface, or funder-controlled roadmap, it should be rejected or renegotiated.

**Consequences:**

- Prototype-funder discovery can proceed with a clear accept/reject screen.
- Commercial discovery should prioritize independent knowledge-worker workflows that fund core planning, privacy, affect, worker, and projection capabilities.
- Enterprise opportunities are acceptable only when they preserve contributor sovereignty and remain subordinate to the planning-kernel trunk.
- Ethereum or DAO-related opportunities must not drive token-first positioning.
- Governance review remains required for ambiguous funding terms, especially exclusivity, IP assignment, confidentiality, roadmap control, and custom-branch obligations.

---

## UBU-D0088: Committed-contributor onboarding is public, bounded, and fixture-first

**Status:** Accepted

The minimum onboarding path for serious, self-directed contributors is a public, bounded path from context to a small verified contribution. It must not depend on private project-owner chats, unstated roadmap knowledge, private calendars, private GitHub data, or credentials.

A contributor should first read:

- the project overview and core principles in `DESIGN.md`;
- the model-committee dogfooding, Phase 1 public demo, GitHub dogfooding, design-process, open-core, and Phase 1 Compartment sections of `DESIGN.md`;
- the accepted decisions for open-core boundary, minimal Compartment promise, small core cohort recruitment, concrete outreach actions, and commercial self-governance red lines;
- the specific public issue, fixture, or model-committee artifact they intend to touch.

The first command should be a no-private-access local smoke check. For `model-committee`, the expected first command is `uv run model-committee doctor`, followed by a fake-provider or fixture-backed test/run when the implementation repo supports it. Equivalent first commands for later modules must avoid private tokens and should make missing optional providers or credentials visible as diagnostics rather than hidden prerequisites.

The first contribution should be one of: a synthetic or redacted workflow example, a fixture, a parser/validation test, review of a `model-committee` run artifact, documentation tied to a specific open question, or a narrow implementation-ready issue with explicit acceptance criteria. New contributors should not begin with hidden-roadmap work, direct GitHub mutation, Compartment-sensitive payloads, private-context reconstruction, broad planner rewrites, or module ownership.

Before implementation work, contributors must understand these boundaries: canonical design state lives only in committed canonical files; `model-committee` is advisory; v0.1 provider/network and no-auto-apply limits are hard; GitHub is a projection, not the source of truth; LLMs are advisory, not canonical planners; Compartment and low-security-content promises constrain data routing; the planning kernel and contributor-facing integration surface are open core; user sovereignty and mode boundaries are non-negotiable.

Contributor progression is staged:

## UBU-D0089: First prototype-funder workflow is commitment-risk review plus next-day plan

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4

The smallest fundable workflow for privacy-sensitive independent technical consultants is a local client commitment-risk review plus next-day Plan. It addresses the pain of discovering too late that multi-client commitments, deadlines, dependencies, energy, and unavailable time no longer fit.

The first prototype should not require full inbox, notes, invoice, or message-body ingestion. Required inputs are manual client/project declarations, current commitments/deadlines, tasks or work items, current availability, compartment labels, and a current or stale affect Snapshot. Optional inputs are calendar busy/free blocks and GitHub issue/PR references when the consultant explicitly connects them. Email, notes, invoices, and private client documents may be represented only as user-approved structural references or later explicit connectors that obey Compartment rules.

The primary output is a compartment-aware weekly commitment-risk report with a next-day default Plan. The report should show each client/project compartment at a structural level, identify overcommitment, deadline risk, stale or blocked work, cross-client dependency pressure, and affect/energy constraint risk, then propose the next concrete work window. The output must be inspectable and recalculable from explicit data; it must not rank client value secretly or expose one client's sensitive payload in another client view.

A daily plan alone is too generic for the first funded prototype. A client-compartment view alone is too static. A weekly review alone may be too passive. The smallest valuable bundle is the weekly risk review plus the next-day Plan because it converts private commitments into immediate action without requiring broad surveillance-style ingestion.

Paid prototype work remains on the trunk only if the implementation uses reusable open-core structures: Objectives for client/project outcomes, Tasks for commitments, Compartments for client separation, Logs for declarations and actuals, Calendar/Plan generation for schedule recommendations, risk reports for commitment and dependency pressure, and optional GitHub/calendar ingestion through user-visible routes. Customer-specific templates, data imports, hosting, credentials, and support may remain commercial configuration.

Prototype-funder discovery should test prepaid design-partner structures, not open-ended bespoke consulting. Plausible offers to test are: a paid discovery/review session, a prepaid prototype sponsorship that funds an implementation slice, or a monthly design-partner retainer. As a working hypothesis, discovery can test roughly USD 250-750 for a focused review, USD 2,000-10,000 for a prototype sponsorship, and USD 1,000-3,000/month for a limited design-partner retainer. These are discovery hypotheses, not permanent pricing policy.

---

## UBU-D0090: Long-arc public narrative stays modest and testable

**Status:** Accepted

UbU may say that it grew out of a long personal and technical effort to understand planning, self-governance, privacy, and humane coordination. Public materials should include only enough of that history to explain commitment, design maturity, and why the project has more structure than a fresh prototype.

Modern LLMs should be described as changing the feasibility frontier for UbU, not as making success automatic. The grounded claim is that LLMs now make interpretation, summarization, proposal generation, fixture creation, review, and advisory automation cheap enough to support an explicit planning kernel. LLMs remain bounded assistants; they do not replace UbU's canonical planner, user sovereignty, or inspectable data model.

The long-arc narrative should communicate seriousness and durable possibility. Preferred public phrasing includes `long-running personal and technical project`, `the tools may finally be good enough to build the first narrow version`, `could matter for a long time if the dogfooding and contributor work prove it`, and `worth building carefully in public`.

The detailed version belongs in the first technical essay, selected outreach, talks, and interviews. README-level use should stay short and connect immediately to active dogfooding, concrete contribution paths, and prototype-funder discovery.

Avoid language that implies destiny, superiority, inevitability, or guaranteed world-historical impact. Avoid claims such as `will change the world`, `inevitable`, `once-in-a-generation`, `the future of work`, `solves coordination`, `the only real solution`, `decades ahead`, `everyone will need this`, and `LLMs make this inevitable`.

---

## UBU-D0091: First technical essay makes a precise planning-kernel request

**Status:** Accepted

The first public technical essay should make one central claim: ordinary task managers, calendars, project boards, and opaque AI assistants are useful projections, but they are not enough for real planning because they usually do not model objectives, state transitions, dependencies, constraints, logs, uncertainty, affect, and recalculation as explicit objects.

The working title should be:

> The Planning Kernel: What Task Managers Leave Out

The previously proposed title, `The Planning Kernel: Why Your Task Manager Is Lying to You`, should not be used as the working public title. It is memorable, but it implies accusation and undermines the humane, problem-first tone.

The essay should explain affect-blind planning as human-incomplete planning. Fatigue, stress, boredom, motivation, emotional load, recovery, and dignity are planning constraints. They are not excuses, decorative wellness features, or moral failures. A plan that ignores them can be internally organized while still being unrealistic for the human who must execute it.

The essay should distinguish UbU from adjacent tools as follows:

- task managers record intended work;
- calendars allocate time;
- project boards track workflow status;
- opaque AI assistants can generate plausible suggestions;

---

## UBU-D0092: Plan quality includes fast feedback, dignity, limits, and humane stretch

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.5.1

Phase 1 models human-complete plan quality as derived analysis over Plans, Tasks, Logs, Snapshots, affect constraints, and risk reports. It does not add a first-class canonical PlanQuality object in MVP. Any cached assessment is advisory and recalculable.

A candidate Plan should be checked for:

- fast feedback: important work has an observable checkpoint soon enough to revise before large loss;
- checkpoint coverage: success, failure, blocked preconditions, user overrides, affect Snapshots, or External Events can reveal whether the Plan is still accurate;
- affect margin: scheduled work does not consume energy, stress, mood, or recovery capacity beyond configured user-mode limits;
- dignity preservation: failure presentation does not moralize the user, expose avoidable embarrassment, or reuse wording that frames observed limits as character flaws;
- non-blaming revision: failed execution should suggest model repair, smaller Tasks, added checkpoints, updated estimates, recovery, clarification, delegation, or Objective reconsideration;
- humane stretch: the Plan may exceed the current baseline when feedback is close, recovery margin remains, and the expected post-plan state is not worse;
- destructive pressure: the Plan depends on overriding observed limits, lacks recovery, hides failure until too late, or repeatedly requires performance above observed capacity.

Task failure remains an ordinary Log result, but the interpretation of that failure should be plan-centered. UbU should treat failure as evidence about estimates, constraints, dependencies, affect state, interruptions, or Objective fit unless the user explicitly records another interpretation.

---

## UBU-D0093: Public recruitment invites several serious contributors into bounded paths

**Status:** Accepted

UbU's public recruitment copy should invite a small core cohort of serious, self-directed contributors, not a single co-builder, founding slot, or privileged insider. Seriousness is shown by concrete public follow-up: a workflow example, design review, fixture/test contribution, model-committee artifact review, narrow implementation-ready issue, or repeated reviewed work on a bounded subsystem.

Baseline public copy:

> UbU is looking for a small core cohort of serious, self-directed contributors. Good first contributions include workflow examples, design review, synthetic or redacted fixtures, parser or validation tests, model-committee artifact review, and narrow implementation-ready issues. If the work keeps the planning kernel inspectable, privacy-first, and useful for dogfooding, there is room for multiple contributors to earn bounded ownership over subsystems.

Public materials may name the contributor stages from onboarding: workflow informant, design reviewer, fixture/test contributor, implementation contributor, and bounded module owner. They may also route prototype funders and design partners into discovery, but prototype funding is not a contributor rank and must remain governed by the self-governance funding red lines.

The distinction between serious contribution and passive interest should be concrete rather than exclusionary. Passive interest is welcome when it produces workflow examples, design feedback, useful introductions, prototype-funder leads, public issue comments, or future contributor candidates. Serious contributor language should emphasize bounded public work, tests or fixtures, reviewed artifacts, and eventual subsystem ownership.

Avoid public phrases that imply scarcity or competition for one role, including `the co-builder`, `highest-priority contact`, `one founding slot`, `only serious builder`, `competing for a role`, `exclusive inner circle`, `prove you belong`, `hand-picked elite`, and similar language. If `co-builder` is ever used informally, it should not be singular or described as the single highest-priority outcome.

ETHConf and similar follow-up should classify people by their most useful next concrete action: send one workflow example, review a model-committee artifact, comment on a public design question, contribute a fixture/test, take a narrow implementation-ready issue, introduce a serious contributor, or discuss a trunk-compatible prototype sponsorship. Enthusiasm alone is not validation until it becomes one of these follow-ups.

---

## UBU-D0094: Release Outreach Pipeline makes releases explain themselves

**Status:** Accepted

UbU accepts the Release Outreach Pipeline feature bundle, with the tagline:

> UbU should make every release explain itself.

Release management in UbU should treat public and project-facing explanation artifacts as first-class release outputs. In addition to code, tests, changelogs, builds, and deployment artifacts, a meaningful release may require user-facing release notes, developer-facing release notes, screenshots, scripted UI-demo captures, video scripts, narration text, captions, YouTube metadata, public posts, known-limitations summaries, and contributor calls-to-action.

For UbU-runs-UbU, each minor release should normally produce a release outreach package when there is enough change to explain. The package should be derived from current repo state, release notes, accepted decisions, closed issues, updated design files, automated UI screenshots, scripted demo recordings, test fixtures, and explicitly labeled future plans.

Generated outreach must be evidence-bound. Claims about implemented behavior should be traceable to implemented features, accepted decisions, closed issues, release notes, test artifacts, screenshots, demo recordings, or other recorded evidence. Mock behavior, future plans, and speculative goals must be labeled as such.

The pipeline should support a fast public explanation path for nontechnical or lightly technical users and a sharper developer call-to-action path for serious contributors. A video can show the simple user-facing loop - bootstrap, one next task, explanation, feedback, and humane relationship or goal prompts - then close by showing UbU dogfooding its own GitHub issues, design docs, release tasks, and contributor needs.

The feature generalizes beyond UbU's own outreach. Project-management configurations should be able to define communication Objectives for users, developers, maintainers, funders, internal stakeholders, customers, community members, or other audiences. Release communication should become ordinary project work, not an afterthought.

Publication is gated by default. UbU may draft, assemble, render, and prepare outreach artifacts automatically, but external publication requires explicit human approval unless a project has configured a narrow trusted auto-publication policy. The pipeline must respect Compartment, Identity, export, and public-projection boundaries, and it must not leak private planning notes, contributor communications, personal data, or sensitive screenshots into public artifacts.

The implementation should be staged:

- Phase 0: manually structured release notes, screenshot lists, scripts, and calls-to-action.

## UBU-D0095: Worker authority uses scoped capability grants

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §25

Automation Worker authority is represented through explicit capability grants associated with a worker Identity. The Identity is the external-facing actor and credential subject; the capability grant is the authoritative object that says what the worker may do for a specific parent UbU instance.

Phase 1 capability verbs are `task.read`, `objective.read`, `universe_state.read_subset`, `external_event.append`, `snapshot.submit`, `mutation_request.submit`, `recalculation.request`, and `projection.github.request_update`. Direct creation or mutation of Tasks, Objectives, UniverseState, `pipeline_state`, or GitHub projection state is not granted to workers in Phase 1. Workers submit mutation or projection requests, and the canonical instance validates, applies, rejects, and logs the result.

Capability grants may be scoped by object ID, Objective subtree, Task set, Compartment, external integration, operation kind, and time window. Compartment policy is a hard upper bound on any worker grant: a grant cannot authorize cloud LLM routing, external export, worker handoff, or payload disclosure that the relevant Compartment forbids.

Workers can be revoked by disabling or deleting grants and invalidating or rotating credentials. Revocation affects future access and submissions only; prior Log entries remain append-only history. Credential rotation creates a new credential version for the worker Identity while preserving audit continuity unless the underlying grants are changed.

A worker may serve multiple organization-mode or user-mode parent instances only through separate parent-specific grants, credentials, and audit trails. Cross-parent data sharing is forbidden unless each parent explicitly grants the route and all relevant Compartment policies allow it. User-mode workers are allowed, but access to affect or other personal data must use narrow read-subset grants and obey Compartment and low-security disclosure rules.

---

## UBU-D0096: Phase 1 requires bootstrap interview and next-action focus UX

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4.1

UbU Phase 1 must include a minimal first-person user-facing loop, not merely an internal planner, GitHub importer, model-committee loop, or project-state analyzer.

Phase 1 requires two user-facing UX primitives:

1. **Bootstrap interview**: UbU begins by asking a small number of questions that help form an initial model of the user, current context, important Objectives, relevant constraints, current or stale affect Snapshot, and immediate dogfooding/project context.

2. **Next-action focus mode**: UbU can present one recommended next Task at a time, with an explanation of why that Task matters now. The full Plan remains inspectable, but the default user experience may reduce immediate cognitive load by showing a single next action.

The Phase 1 next-action screen should include, at minimum:

- the recommended Task;
- estimated duration or work window when available;
- why this Task matters now;
- what inputs or constraints UbU considered;
- current affect or stale-affect status when relevant;

---

## UBU-D0097: Phase 1 MVP scope is frozen around single-user GitHub dogfooding

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4.1

Phase 1 is frozen as the minimum single-user `user_mode` implementation that proves UbU can coordinate UbU's own development through explicit state, an inspectable Plan, one recommended next action, feedback, recalculation, and bounded GitHub projection.

The exact Phase 1 feature set is:

- local single-user UbU instance for UbU-runs-UbU;
- bootstrap interview, current or stale affect Snapshot handling, and initial Objective/Task seed creation;
- live or fixture-backed GitHub import for issues, PRs, reviews, CI events, milestones, comments, and source links;
- ExternalReference-style mapping between GitHub objects and UbU Objectives, Tasks, External Events, and Logs;
- MVP Objective, Preference, Task, Container, UniverseState, Snapshot, Plan, Calendar, Log, Identity, Relationship, Compartment, Automation Worker, External Event, External Reference, and deferred Association-related schemas only to the depth required for the dogfooding loop;
- schedulable Static and Dynamic Tasks with Objective links, duration, dependency/precondition/effect fields, lifecycle status, and moot handling;
- lightweight UniverseState mutation and precondition evaluation sufficient for Task effects, affect, relationship-relevant facts, and GitHub/project facts;
- append-only per-instance Logs with provenance, correction, annotation, worker-submission, and recalculation-trigger entries;

---

## UBU-D0098: GitHub external links use first-class External References

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §19

GitHub-to-UbU links are represented by first-class `ExternalReference` objects rather than by embedding all many-to-many source links directly on core objects. Lightweight `external_refs` fields may still appear on Log entries, provenance payloads, or import artifacts as convenience references, but they are not the authoritative external-link model.

MVP `ExternalReference` required fields are `external_reference_id`, `external_system`, `external_object_type`, `external_object_id`, `ubu_object_type`, `ubu_object_id`, `relation_type`, `confidence`, `created_by_identity_ref`, `created_at`, `last_verified_at`, `sync_policy`, `projection_policy`, and `provenance`.

Phase 1 external references may target Objectives, Tasks, External Events, and Log entries. This supports GitHub Issues mapping to multiple Objectives, Objectives mapping to multiple Issues, PRs and CI runs being retained as External Events, and comments or reviews acting as evidence for Tasks, Objective transitions, reconciliation, or projection decisions.

MVP relation types are `represents`, `supports`, `evidence_for`, `source_event_for`, `projection_of`, `duplicate_of`, and `supersedes`. Relation types are schema-controlled enums in MVP, not free-form labels.

Duplicate detection uses a normalized uniqueness key over `external_system`, `external_object_type`, `external_object_id`, `ubu_object_type`, `ubu_object_id`, and `relation_type`. Importers must normalize equivalent GitHub identifiers such as repository name, issue or PR number, node ID, URL, comment ID, run ID, and webhook delivery ID before comparing. Reobserving the same external reference updates verification metadata or creates an idempotent no-op Log entry rather than duplicating the external reference. Distinct relation types between the same objects are allowed.

Automation Workers cannot directly create or mutate canonical External References in Phase 1. They may submit external-reference mutation requests only through authorized `mutation_request.submit` capability grants. The canonical instance validates authority, Compartment/export policy, duplicate keys, expected prior version, and provenance, then logs applied or rejected outcomes.

## UBU-D0099: Psychological theory inputs are calibration, discovery, preview, and review layers

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.2.1

UbU should not expose internally computed utility values as user-facing truth. Derived utils remain transient computational artifacts used for scheduling, ranking, and comparison. User-facing value remains grounded in explicit Preferences, user declarations, Logs, Snapshots, review, and later correction.

Psychological and philosophical decision-theory inputs should usually enter Phase 1 through calibration, discovery, Calendar preview, Log review, reports, and reusable Tasks rather than through a large new psychology ontology.

Prospect-theory implications are accepted as preference-calibration requirements, not as an exposed utility model. UbU may show default preference examples and common-situation emotional-value examples during onboarding, Calendar preview, or Log review so the user can make more thoughtful Preference statements. These examples are grounding aids. They do not become canonical Preferences unless accepted by the user.

Temporal discounting is usually part of Preference for short-horizon Phase 1 planning. Long-horizon Objectives may later require explicit future-self or commitment-device modeling, but this is not a Phase 1 blocker.

Habit-related behavior should be handled through discovery mode, Logs, Snapshots, configured integrations, sensor-derived observations, and later clarification prompts. Discovery mode is a user-selectable workflow state that the user may choose at any time, especially from a mobile app with useful embedded sensors. Discovery mode supports later Log review and UbU-directed reconciliation for undetailed or under-specified time periods.

The Calendar is advisory. User overrides remain authoritative and should be treated as model evidence, not disobedience. Repeated overrides may trigger review, preference recalibration, Task decomposition, Objective reconsideration, or habit-pattern hypotheses only after appropriate user-visible reconciliation.

Calendar preview and Log review are notable Tasks that should run on a regular basis. They help verify whether UbU is correctly modeling the user's intended behavior, actual behavior, affective constraints, and preference judgments. These review Tasks should remain inspectable, interruptible, and adjustable by the user.

Self-determination theory and theory of planned behavior should primarily inform Calendar preview, Log review, reporting annotations, and optional user comments about motivation, autonomy, competence, relatedness, attitude, subjective norms, perceived control, and expected execution. Detailed modeling of those constructs remains open unless required by a concrete MVP workflow.

Narrative identity is partly addressed through Objectives and Reports. Social identity theory, social choice theory, and game theory are important post-MVP open-question areas and should be tracked explicitly without blocking Phase 1 implementation.

---

## UBU-D0100: Snapshots are immutable partial observed assertions

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §12

Snapshots are partial observed assertions over specific UniverseState fields. They are not full assertions of all UniverseState and do not imply that omitted fields are absent, unchanged, or unknown. Applying a Snapshot updates only the fields included in that Snapshot.

Snapshot records are immutable once accepted into the append-only Log. The original Snapshot observation is never edited or deleted as canonical history. Annotation, correction, and revocation are represented by later Log entries that point to the original Snapshot observation or Log entry.

MVP confidence is stored at both levels: a required snapshot-level confidence summarizes the observation as a whole, and optional per-field confidence overrides may be present when different observed dimensions have different reliability. If a field has no per-field confidence, it inherits the snapshot-level confidence. For affect Snapshots, the existing MVP rule remains: affect confidence may be treated globally across affect dimensions, with per-dimension confidence deferred unless a Snapshot explicitly provides per-field confidence.

Conflict resolution is field-local. Latest observed Snapshot data overrides simulated state for conflicting fields. User-declared Snapshots have top priority over sensor-derived, imported, inferred, or worker-submitted observations in MVP. If two user-declared Snapshots conflict on the same field, the latest `effective_at` or Snapshot timestamp wins unless a later correction supersedes it. For non-user observations, the application algorithm may use source priority, effective timestamp, and confidence, but confidence does not defeat an explicit user declaration in MVP.

A Snapshot can be corrected or revoked, but only through a new Log entry. Correction that replaces the observed state creates a new Snapshot and links it to the corrected Snapshot or Log entry. Revocation without replacement creates a correction/revocation Log entry that excludes the original Snapshot from corrected query views while preserving the historical claim.

---

## UBU-D0101: Organization mode uses shared objects without intrinsic affect

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §26

Organization mode uses the shared UbU core object model except where fields or behavior are intrinsically personal-affect-specific. Objective, Preference, Task, Container, UniverseState, Snapshot, Plan, Calendar, Log, Identity, Relationship, Compartment, Automation Worker, External Event, External Reference, and deferred Association-related objects are available in organization mode to the depth required by the organization or project planning workflow.

Organization mode does not model intrinsic affect. In mode-specific schemas, intrinsic affect fields are absent. In shared implementation schemas that contain affect-capable fields for storage or migration convenience, those fields are disabled in organization mode and validators must reject organization-created intrinsic-affect values rather than silently treating them as unused.

Relationship objects may exist in organization mode without affect dimensions. Organization-mode Relationships represent structured UniverseState between Identities such as contributors, maintainers, workers, projects, vendors, integrations, or external organizations. Non-affect relationship-relevant project information belongs in ordinary UniverseState facts, External Events, Logs, External References, candidate AssociationAttestations, Objectives, Tasks, or risk reports. Organization mode must not claim that the organization has a private emotional state toward another Identity.

Organization-created Objectives, Preferences, and Tasks require `authority_source` metadata as defined in `UBU-D0185`.

Before RBAC exists, organization-mode human users are represented as operator Identities with admin-equivalent authority over the instance. This is an MVP simplification only. Their actions must still be logged with actor Identity and provenance so future RBAC can be introduced without rewriting history.

Organization-mode instances may later receive limited signals from personal user-mode instances only through explicit user-controlled sharing, Identity-mediated authorization, Compartment/export checks, and clear provenance. Phase 1 does not implement personal-to-organization cross-instance sharing. Future designs should prefer structural signals such as availability, commitment status, task completion, or user-approved projection summaries rather than raw affect, private relationship state, or broad personal context.

---

## UBU-D0102: Phase 1 bootstrap and next-action UX stays narrow and inspectable

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4.1

The Phase 1 bootstrap interview and next-action focus UX are the first user-facing proof that UbU is more than an internal planner, GitHub importer, or automation loop. They must stay narrow, inspectable, and honest about implemented capability.

The bootstrap interview should ask only the minimum useful set of questions needed to seed the current user, context, available work window, important Objectives, relevant constraints, and current or stale affect Snapshot. It should not imply broad personal-data ingestion, therapeutic authority, complete life modeling, or autonomous coaching unless those capabilities have been separately implemented and disclosed.

The next-action focus mode should present one recommended Task at a time with a clear explanation of why that Task matters now. The full Plan must remain inspectable. One-task focus is a cognitive-load reduction pattern, not permission to hide the planner, omit Calendar preview, or turn UbU into opaque automation.

This decision is compatible with the Compact Calendar planning architecture. The default Plan supplies the inspectable ordered context behind the next-action recommendation, while reactive recalculation keeps the recommendation responsive when reality diverges. The planning layer should support the narrow UX rather than expanding Phase 1 scope beyond the single-user dogfooding loop.

---

## UBU-D0107: Default Plan selection uses Plan probability over deterministic optimized Plans

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15

Plan optimization and default Plan selection are distinct operations.

Each Plan represented on a Calendar is deterministic. Once materialized, it is a time-independent representation of predicted Actions/Tasks, similar in shape to a future-facing Log projection. A Plan may eventually include predicted sensor states and expected UniverseState transitions, but it does not internally evaluate its own probability after representation.

Each candidate Plan should be individually optimized for value while satisfying the constraints applicable to the modeled branch that produced it. These constraints include dependencies, deadlines, preconditions, Calendar Logic, affect constraints in `user_mode`, and user Preferences.

The planning algorithm models probabilistic parameters such as Task duration distributions, Task success or failure, external events, interruptions, availability changes, affect uncertainty, and sensor predictions. A particular modeled combination of those probabilistic inputs yields a deterministic candidate Plan. UbU may ascribe a **Plan probability** to that candidate Plan: the probability mass of the branch or parameter combination that yields it.

The default Plan is the deterministic candidate Plan, or one of multiple equal candidate Plans, with the highest Plan probability overall.

---

## UBU-D0108: Skeletonization and legitimization precede default Plan candidate search

**Status:** Accepted as provisional planning architecture → DESIGN.md §15

This decision supersedes the narrower framing that a DFS or DFS-like process directly produces the full default Plan as the conceptual foundation of Compact Calendar planning. DFS-like, BFS-like, greedy, local-search, GPU-parallel, or solver-backed methods may still be used as implementation techniques, but the planning architecture now begins with explicit skeletonization and legitimization.

The planner first creates a **skeleton Plan**. The skeleton Plan affixes Static Tasks, walks backward through dependency DAGs from terminal Static Tasks to dependency roots, and schedules prerequisites before dependents. It is a dependency-valid causal foundation, not an optimized or fully human-viable Plan.

The planner then performs **legitimization**: the process of adding the minimum constraints and support Tasks required to make the skeleton Plan plausibly executable by a real user. This includes affect, recovery, transition, rest, sustainability, and similar human-viability constraints.

The **legitimized skeleton Plan** is the minimum feasible baseline against which richer candidate Plans are compared. Candidate Plan generation, Plan probability assignment, optional Task filling, value optimization, and reactive branch construction occur after this baseline exists.

A short-horizon reactive layer, likely BFS-like or policy/repair based, remains necessary for near-term divergence involving duration variation, early completion, late completion, interruptions, external events, affect shifts, user overrides, and recalculation triggers. The provisional reactive branch horizon remains one hour, with a provisional short-horizon coverage target of `0.99` probability mass. These are configurable heuristics, not immutable design law.

---

## UBU-D0109: Early completion pulls the next valid Dynamic Task forward

**Status:** Accepted as provisional runtime behavior → DESIGN.md §15

When a Task completes earlier than expected, UbU should normally pull the next valid Dynamic Task forward to the current time, provided that dependencies, preconditions, affect constraints, location constraints, Calendar Logic, and user-visible policy allow it.

This supports conservative duration estimates. If the scheduler avoids overly optimistic durations, then early completion is easy to absorb: the next Dynamic Task can begin immediately instead of forcing a disruptive full replanning cycle.

Static Tasks keep fixed start times. If the next Static Task is not yet available and all predetermined Dynamic Tasks before it have been completed or blocked, UbU may offer gap-filling suggestions. The exact evergreen Task model remains open.

---

## UBU-D0110: Compact Calendar planning supports adaptive time granularity

**Status:** Accepted as provisional default policy → DESIGN.md §16

Compact Calendar planning should support configurable time deltas. The provisional defaults are:

- full-detail planning delta: `1 minute`;
- mobile moderate delta: `5 minutes`;
- mobile low-power or offline delta: `15 minutes`;
- reactive branch horizon: `1 hour`;
- short-horizon branch coverage target: `0.99` probability mass.

A one-minute delta aligns with common calendar behavior and should be available when resources permit. Mobile-only, low-power, or offline modes may use coarser deltas to preserve battery, reduce computation, and keep local recalculation responsive.

Known offline windows, such as flights or planned disconnection, should trigger preparatory precomputation when connectivity and compute resources are available. Unexpected offline operation should degrade gracefully to cached explicit state, local planning, coarser deltas, and reduced branch depth.

---

## UBU-D0111: External compute is optional and backend-agnostic for the open-core planning loop

**Status:** Accepted

Cloud or external compute may improve performance, granularity, analysis depth, stochastic branch coverage, and expensive legitimization, but it must not be a hidden mandatory dependency for the open-core planning loop.

The FOSS core should be indifferent to the execution backend. Planning work may run on a mobile device, a local desktop or laptop, a Phase 2 user-owned worker, a dedicated user-owned appliance, an UbU corporate hosted service, a third-party compatible provider, or a future privacy-preserving compute backend.

Execution-provider selection should treat GPU suitability as a first-class criterion. Many practical devices have much more parallel arithmetic capacity in GPU-like hardware than in CPU-bound exact solvers. UbU should therefore prefer hybrid algorithms in which CPU or conservative exact logic certifies skeleton validity, hard constraints, and explanations, while GPU-capable search, simulation, scoring, and learned-model inference evaluate large candidate sets, robustness, affect load, and premium cloud planning. GPU search may propose; exact or conservative validation must certify.

External execution must be mediated by explicit APIs, capability grants, Compartment policy, provenance, user-visible routing decisions, and privacy controls. PII stripping, encryption, redaction, compartment-aware payload minimization, and future privacy-preserving compute such as practical FHE-backed or comparable encrypted computation are strategic directions, but not Phase 1 guarantees unless implemented and disclosed. Cloud planning payloads should transmit the structured timing, dependency, value, constraint, criticality, and legitimacy information needed by the algorithm while stripping or compartmentalizing unnecessary personal detail. Compact Calendar results should return small references, IDs, decision envelopes, explanations, and repair metadata rather than raw personal context where possible.

---

## UBU-D0112: Cloud LLM integration is provider-neutral, local-first, and policy-routed

**Status:** Accepted

UbU's premier LLM execution path remains local-first use of a user-controlled local model provider such as `ollama`, but cloud LLMs are accepted as optional execution providers when the user, Compartment policy, cost policy, and task sensitivity allow them.

The core architecture should model LLM execution through a provider-neutral routing layer rather than treating a local `ollama` call as the only conceptual interface. Supported or planned provider classes include local model providers, user-configured BYOK cloud APIs, optional UbUCorp managed gateways, user-owned remote workers, and future compatible third-party providers.

Cloud LLM execution is not semantically equivalent to local execution. It crosses an external trust boundary and must be governed by Compartment policy, context minimization, redaction where appropriate, cost controls, provenance, visible routing decisions, and output validation. Cloud LLM output remains advisory unless transformed into canonical UbU state through explicit accepted objects and Logs.

UbUCorp may offer managed hosted inference, model routing, support, integrations, enterprise controls, and commercial provider relationships. That convenience service must not become a hidden dependency of the FOSS core, the open-core planning loop, or the UbU protocol. A commercial exclusive provider relationship for UbUCorp's hosted service is acceptable only if the core remains local-capable, provider-neutral, BYOK-capable, and self-hostable.

---

## UBU-D0113: Associations are Identity-scoped perceived coordination structures

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §19

UbU adopts **Association** as the canonical term for the earlier social-formation concept. An Association is an Identity-scoped model of an emergent group-like coordination pattern. It may represent a friend group, party, amateur league, FOSS project, contributor crew, skill network, marketplace, nonprofit, company, DAO-like project, or other formal or informal group.

Associations are not assumed to have globally objective membership, authority, boundaries, or interpersonal identity. By default, an Association exists as a local, perspective-bound model perceived by an Identity and supported by evidence. Other Identities may maintain overlapping but non-identical models of what they call the same Association.

UbU should represent Association facts through local perception, AssociationAttestations, Relationships, shared Objectives, commitments, norms, Logs, and External References. Legal entities, corporate filing numbers, GitHub organizations, websites, event pages, chat rooms, contracts, payment addresses, and other institutional or external records are External References or evidence, not the complete social reality of the Association.

A future SharedAssociationDescriptor may provide a signed or reviewable shared artifact that multiple Identities can reference, but it is not a God's-eye truth object. It is a coordination artifact that can be accepted, disputed, superseded, or interpreted differently by different Identities.

---

## UBU-D0114: Organizational introspection is a first-class UbU feature

**Status:** Accepted

UbU should treat organizational introspection as a first-class feature, not merely as a side effect of project management or future Association modeling.

Organizational introspection is UbU's ability to analyze evidence-bearing records from an Association, such as documentation, meeting notes, issue trackers, pull requests, governance discussions, chat logs, board minutes, public Discord or IRC history, outreach notes, and other permitted records, then generate reviewable, provenance-backed AssociationAttestations and feedback questions about the Association's actual behavior.

The goal is to help an Association inspect whether its real priorities, overrides, undocumented roles, decision paths, commitments, and work patterns are consistent with its declared mission, values, objectives, and public claims. Generated claims are candidate attestations with evidence, confidence, provenance, review status, and disclosure policy. They are not authoritative social truth.

This feature mirrors personal UbU introspection. For a person, UbU asks whether actual behavior matches stated values and Objectives. For an Association, UbU asks whether actual work, decisions, and resource allocation match declared mission and commitments.

---

## UBU-D0115: EthConf outreach uses one core pitch plus lightweight audience lanes

**Status:** Accepted

EthConf outreach should not splinter into many separate campaigns. The project should use one core UbU thesis with lightweight audience variants for FOSS contributors, prototype funders, general EthConf attendees, and a modest cypherpunk/privacy-builder lane.

The shared thesis is that UbU is local-first, user-sovereign AI planning and coordination infrastructure. It can run locally for privacy, use optional cloud LLM execution when policy allows, and eventually help Associations coordinate through explicit Identities, commitments, evidence, and bounded disclosure.

The cypherpunk/privacy lane should frame **Skill Barter marketplace** as a future specialization of Association modeling: lawful, privacy-preserving skill barter and skilled-work coordination through pseudonymous Identities, scoped work agreements, reputation without unnecessary doxxing, commitments, and user-chosen settlement references where lawful. It must not be framed as an illicit marketplace, sanctions-evasion tool, tax-evasion tool, or token-first product.

---

## UBU-D0116: EthConf outreach dogfoods Association formation and organizational introspection

**Status:** Accepted

UbU's EthConf outreach is itself an Association-forming workflow. The project owner is attempting to form an ad hoc Association around the UbU project through conversations with contributors, reviewers, funders, workflow informants, privacy/cypherpunk builders, and possible design partners.

This outreach should be treated as dogfooding, not mere marketing. Notes, follow-ups, contact classifications, public artifacts, private/redacted observations, and subsequent commitments can be modeled as Objectives, Tasks, Logs, Relationships, External Events, External References, and candidate AssociationAttestations.

The outreach process should later be submitted to LLM-assisted or manually reviewed organizational introspection. UbU should ask whether the actual outreach behavior proves that the project pursued its stated goals: recruiting serious contributors, pressure-testing the design, finding workflow examples, identifying compatible funding, and preserving the privacy-first self-governance mission.

---

## UBU-D0117: Context-rich cross-user messaging is a premier Phase 3 feature

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §20

Phase 3 minimal multi-user coordination should include a limited but meaningful form of cross-user contextual messaging. This should be treated as a premier Phase 3 feature, not merely as an incidental transport detail.

A UbU message is not only flat text. It is a communication event that may carry structured planning context. Even a minimal Phase 3 message envelope can help the receiving UbU instance decide whether a message should interrupt the current Plan, be deferred to a later review window, become a Task, update an Objective, or remain ordinary communication history.

A minimal Phase 3 **Message Context Envelope** should include only fields that are safe, useful, and policy-permitted, such as:

- sender and receiver Identity references or external references;
- source system or transport;
- raw or human-readable message body;
- message kind, such as request, status update, question, commitment, blocker, reminder, or FYI;
- topic or associated Objective/Task/Association references when disclosure policy allows them;
- requested response kind and any explicit deadline;
- priority and interrupt recommendation;

---

## UBU-D0118: Legacy messaging adapters may upgrade flat messages into UbU contextual messages

**Status:** Accepted as product and interoperability direction → DESIGN.md §20

UbU should be able to ingest and, where permitted, send through legacy communication systems such as WhatsApp, SMS, email, Discord, IRC, Slack, Matrix, or similar systems.

When only one side uses UbU, the legacy message remains a flat external input. UbU may scan, classify, summarize, and convert it into local candidate Tasks, Events, Logs, Relationship observations, or Association evidence, subject to user permission and integration policy.

When both sides use UbU, the two instances should be able to translate the legacy exchange into a UbU-native contextual message format. Depending on the transport and policy, this may happen through a side channel, an attached envelope, an agreed encoding, a linkable External Reference, or another adapter-specific mechanism. The raw legacy text remains the user-visible message; the UbU envelope supplies structured context.

This creates a practical bridge from legacy systems into richer UbU-to-UbU communication without requiring the rest of the world to abandon existing messaging platforms first.

---

## UBU-D0119: Structured message extraction is a bounded LLM-assisted normalization layer

**Status:** Accepted as architectural direction → DESIGN.md §20

UbU will ingest large volumes of unstructured direct-message and group-chat text from legacy systems. A dedicated **Message Context Extractor** should normalize those inputs into strict UbU JSON structures.

The extractor should take raw message text plus available metadata, such as source system, channel type, channel purpose, sender, receiver, Identity mapping, Association mapping, timestamp, thread context, Relationship context, and Compartment policy. It should output bounded structures describing message kind, topic, priority, interrupt level, candidate Tasks, Objective links, assumptions, ambiguities, actionability, response expectation, confidence, and provenance.

The extractor is not the canonical planner and must not silently mutate canonical state. Its outputs are candidate interpretations that pass through schema validation, provenance marking, confidence scoring, repair loops, and user or policy acceptance where required.

Phase 3 and early post-MVP implementations should begin with general LLMs constrained by strict schemas, grammar-constrained output where practical, validation, and repair. Fine-tuned, distilled, or adapter-trained extractor models may become attractive after UbU has stable schemas and enough corrected examples. Training a new foundation model from scratch is not currently justified.

---

## UBU-D0120: Personalized voice/TTS descriptors are optional consent-gated communication metadata

**Status:** Accepted as future product direction, not Phase 1 scope

UbU may eventually support optional voice or pronunciation descriptors so that a receiving UbU instance can render text messages using text-to-speech that approximates the sender's usual voice, pronunciation, cadence, or expressive style.

This can be viewed as a communication-compression feature: instead of sending a noisy audio recording, a user may send text plus a voice descriptor or voice-profile reference, allowing the receiver's device to synthesize a locally rendered spoken version. The same idea may also help accessibility, hands-free interaction, language learning, and more expressive asynchronous updates.

Voice data is sensitive. A voice descriptor or voice profile must be opt-in, revocable where practical, policy-governed, and clearly separated from authentication. UbU should not treat a synthesized voice as proof that a human actually spoke the words. Implementations should consider visible disclosure, watermarking or provenance markers, anti-impersonation controls, and restrictions on cross-context reuse.

---

## UBU-D0121: Messaging interoperability can support value-led viral outreach without coercive growth loops

**Status:** Accepted as outreach/product direction

Legacy messaging integration can create a natural adoption path. A UbU user interacting with a non-UbU contact may receive immediate value from local extraction, prioritization, task creation, and planning integration. If both people install UbU, they can exchange richer structured context and reduce ambiguity, missed requests, and priority confusion.

This is a plausible viral outreach mechanism: the product becomes more useful when counterparties also use it. However, UbU should not use manipulative dark patterns, spammy invitations, forced signatures, or guilt-based prompts. The adoption message should be value-led: richer coordination, clearer priority, less lost context, and better respect for both users' time.

---

## UBU-D0122: Greedy mean-duration planning is a benchmark, not the canonical planner

**Status:** Accepted as baseline algorithm policy → DESIGN.md §15

UbU may define a deliberately unintelligent greedy baseline planner for comparison. The baseline inserts Static Tasks first, places modeled External Events at their expected mean-point start time where applicable, ranks Dynamic Tasks by temporary value-per-minute from the Preference DAG divided by expected mean duration, and fills time from the earliest available slot forward while checking only local viability. It does not backtrack and should be expected to be inefficient, brittle, and strategically myopic.

This baseline is useful because later planners can be evaluated against a simple deterministic reference: total value, missed deadlines, affect burden, dependency failures, fragility under interruption, and explanation quality should improve over the baseline.

---

## UBU-D0123: Calendar planning begins from explicit UniverseState assumptions

**Status:** Accepted as provisional planning-model requirement → DESIGN.md §15

Every Calendar planning run must begin from an initial UniverseState. For MVP, the preferred case is a deterministic initial UniverseState in which planner-relevant starting facts are known, assumed, or explicitly unresolved. A future probabilistic initial UniverseState may assign probabilities to known possible starting states, but that mode is more complex and likely beyond MVP.

Skeleton Plan generation must check whether dependencies are already satisfied in the initial UniverseState before inserting prerequisite Tasks. A dependency does not automatically mean that a new Task should be scheduled; it means that a required state must be true before the dependent Task begins.

If the planner cannot create a viable skeleton Plan, normal planning should halt and UbU should immediately present a diagnostic explanation. The user should see the failed dependency, conflicting Static Task, impossible timing, cyclic dependency, missing state, or unavailable resource, plus selectable alternatives where possible.

## UBU-D0124: Legitimization makes skeleton Plans human-viable before optional optimization

**Status:** Accepted as provisional planning architecture → DESIGN.md §15

**Legitimization** is the planning phase that takes a skeleton Plan and adds the minimum additional constraints and support Tasks required to make the Plan plausibly executable by the user. It converts a dependency-valid but potentially unrealistic skeleton Plan into a minimally human-viable Plan.

Legitimization may add or enforce affect constraints, recovery Tasks, breaks, meals, rest, sleep, transition buffers, setup/teardown time, context-switch limits, motivation constraints, and other human sustainability requirements. It is distinct from later optimization: it asks whether the Plan could be realistically performed, not whether all available value has been added.

The legitimized skeleton Plan is the baseline feasible Plan. Optional Dynamic Tasks, gap-filling work, and higher-value candidate Plans should be compared against it.

If full legitimization is cheap, it can be used as a frequent validity oracle while adding and removing optional Tasks. If full legitimization is expensive, UbU needs semi-legitimization heuristics such as affect-budget estimates, slack preservation, dependency-fragility scoring, user-mode compatibility checks, local repair checks, and legitimacy-delta estimates before invoking full legitimization on finalist candidates.

## UBU-D0125: Compact Calendar search is GPU-aware hybrid planning

**Status:** Accepted as implementation direction → DESIGN.md §16

UbU should not assume that the central planning engine is a CPU-heavy exact solver. Solver/library selection should treat GPU suitability as a first-class criterion across mobile devices, laptops/desktops, user-owned workers, and cloud providers.

The preferred architecture is hybrid. CPU or conservative exact logic handles dependency graph traversal, skeleton validity, hard constraints, contradiction diagnosis, final validation, and explanation. GPU-capable methods handle large candidate expansion, stochastic scenario simulation, affect scoring, robustness scoring, learned-model inference, and premium cloud planning.

Existing CPU-oriented solvers such as CP-SAT, SMT/MaxSMT, or local-search systems may remain useful for prototypes, exact finalist validation, contradiction explanation, and desktop/server experiments. They should not become the only planning path if GPU-friendly search, simulation, or scoring better matches available compute.

---

## UBU-D0126: Mobile planning is real-time stewardship, not full global optimization

**Status:** Accepted as mobile planning UX direction

A mobile device has the least computational headroom but the highest demand for immediate user-facing adaptation. Mobile UbU therefore should not be designed as the full global planner. Its role is real-time stewardship of Plan legitimacy, user agency, and next-action clarity.

Beyond short-horizon BFS precomputation, compact Calendars should support decision envelopes, protected/flexible/disposable region metadata, last-legitimate-Plan repair, precomputed repair recipes, fast local policy selection, progressive planning feedback, cached explanations, conflict severity levels, next-best-action mode, opportunistic idle/charging computation, optional remote assist without dependency, and uncertainty-aware UI.

The MVP-friendly subset is narrower: Task criticality, last legitimate Plan storage, simple repair rules, conflict severity levels, cached explanations, next-best-action mode, and basic decision envelopes.

---

## UBU-D0127: VoxPopuli is an optional EthConf demo, not a Phase 1 replacement

**Status:** Accepted as optional outreach/demo concept

UbU may demonstrate an optional **VoxPopuli** flow at EthConf: before structured bootstrap questions, a user speaks freely about what they wish would happen, what feels disorganized, or what kind of planning help they want. An LLM-assisted extractor converts that natural-language input into candidate Objectives, Tasks, constraints, preferences, and planning assumptions for the user to inspect, correct, accept, or reject.

The value of this flow is demonstration and trust-building. It shows that LLMs can help turn abstract human concerns into explicit structured planning material, while UbU remains the inspectable planning system that consumes accepted structures.

This must not override the Phase 1 narrow bootstrap requirement. VoxPopuli is optional, experimental, and useful for EthConf/public demonstrations only if it does not displace higher-priority dogfooding, contributor, or funder deliverables.

---

## UBU-D0128: Planning horizons may exceed visible Calendar windows and should front-load fragile prerequisites

**Status:** Accepted as provisional planning architecture → DESIGN.md §15

The user-visible Calendar window and the internal planning horizon do not have to be identical. If the user asks for a one-day Calendar, UbU may need to reason beyond that visible window to avoid cutting dependency chains, Techniques, deadlines, or preparation sequences at the boundary.

Within reasonable detailed planning windows, such as one day to roughly one week, UbU may use a bias toward completing fragile prerequisite work as early as reasonably viable. This is intended to reduce last-minute impossible choices, especially when later interruptions, affect deterioration, external events, or user overrides would otherwise threaten a tight dependency chain.

This early-preparation bias is not unlimited. Beyond a reasonable detailed horizon, preparation may be too premature or speculative. Long-horizon preference and temporal-discounting questions remain separate from short-horizon operational planning. For short operational windows, UbU may treat time discounting as negligible by default, while still respecting explicit user Preferences and current affect.

---

## UBU-D0129: Phase 1 bootstrap and next-action UX uses explicit object-backed minimum loop

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4

The minimum Phase 1 bootstrap interview asks only enough to recommend one useful dogfooding Task from explicit state. The required questions are:

1. `What are you trying to move forward right now?`
2. `Which project context should UbU use for this first session?`
3. `How much usable time do you have for the next work window?`
4. `Is there a deadline, meeting, release target, or external event that changes what matters today?`
5. `What work should UbU consider first?`
6. `What is already blocked, unavailable, or not worth recommending right now?`
7. `How are your energy, stress, and mood right now?`
8. `When choosing between useful work, what should UbU favor today?`

The answers map into existing Phase 1 objects. Project context, availability, deadlines, constraints, fixture/import source, and hard blockers become UniverseState facts, External Events, Tasks, External References, and Log entries as appropriate. Affect answers become a user-declared Snapshot; skipped or stale affect data creates or prioritizes an affect-collection Task. Initial work answers seed Objectives and Tasks. Tradeoff answers become Preferences only when UbU presents an explicit Preference statement and the user accepts it; otherwise they remain Log notes, Objective annotations, or noncanonical preview/review evidence.

---

## UBU-D0130: UniverseState mutations use dotted targets and envelope-level provenance

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §11.3

MVP UniverseState mutation items use dotted string targets. The first target segment names the UniverseState collection: `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`. Remaining segments form the lightweight namespaced key within that collection. Examples include `facts.github.issue.14.pipeline_state`, `numeric_values.affect.energy`, `set_memberships.github.issue.14.labels`, and `event_markers.relationship.rel_123.interactions`.

A mutation item has required `operation` and `target` fields. `payload` is required for all operations except `clear_fact`. `note` is optional for human-readable context. Mutation items do not carry item-level `confidence`, `source`, or `provenance` in MVP; those belong on the containing Task effect, Snapshot, Log entry, worker mutation request, External Reference, import artifact, or projection envelope.

Payload rules are operation-specific. `set_fact` accepts any JSON-compatible value. `clear_fact` has no payload. `increment_numeric` and `decrement_numeric` require numeric delta payloads. `add_membership` and `remove_membership` require JSON scalar member payloads, usually strings. `append_event_marker` requires a JSON object payload representing the lightweight marker.

Mutation lists are unconditional once the containing Task effect succeeds. Per-item conditions are not part of the MVP mutation schema; conditional behavior belongs in Task preconditions, effect success probability, planner branching, or worker/request validation. Implementations should validate the full mutation list before application and apply valid items in list order.

Mutation targets may include affect UniverseState keys in `user_mode`, subject to Snapshot precedence and user sovereignty rules. Organization-mode and worker-mode validators must reject intrinsic-affect mutations. Mutation targets may include Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys, including relationship interaction markers and maintenance facts, but they must respect Compartment policy, mode rules, provenance/logging envelopes, and user-acceptance requirements for private or inferred relationship claims. Task effects, workers, imports, and LLM-assisted flows must not silently overwrite user-declared private affect or Relationship truths.

---

## UBU-D0131: Task preconditions use recursive all_of/any_of predicates

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §10.1

MVP Task preconditions use a recursive boolean object with `all_of` and `any_of` arrays for simple AND/OR composition. A precondition node may be a group node or a leaf predicate. A group node contains `all_of` or `any_of`, each holding one or more precondition nodes. A leaf predicate contains `target`, `predicate`, and optional `expected`.

Precondition targets use the same dotted UniverseState target convention accepted for mutations. The first segment names the UniverseState collection: `facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, or `event_markers`. Remaining segments form the lightweight namespaced key inside that collection.

MVP predicates are `equals`, `member_of`, and `absent`. `equals` compares the target value to a JSON-compatible `expected` value. `member_of` checks whether the JSON scalar `expected` value is present in the target set membership. `absent` checks that the target is not present or has been cleared, and does not use `expected`. Numeric comparisons such as greater-than, less-than, ranges, thresholds, and arithmetic expressions are not in MVP.

Preconditions may reference `event_markers` for deterministic marker presence or equality checks. Preconditions may reference affect-related UniverseState keys in `user_mode`, subject to Snapshot precedence and user sovereignty rules; organization-mode and worker-mode validators must reject intrinsic-affect preconditions. Preconditions may reference Relationship-relevant UniverseState keys, including relationship interaction markers and maintenance facts, but private or inferred relationship claims remain subject to Compartment policy, mode rules, provenance/logging envelopes, and user acceptance where required.

A failed precondition makes the Task blocked for planning and execution. It does not make the Task invalid. `unschedulable` is a derived planner result when an otherwise valid Task cannot be placed in the current Calendar scope while satisfying preconditions and Calendar Logic. `invalid` is reserved for malformed Tasks, malformed precondition schema, forbidden targets, or canonical-state contradictions. Unknown, unavailable, or partially modeled preconditions are treated as absent in MVP unless the user or importer explicitly records a deterministic predicate.

## UBU-D0132: Realtime multimodal LLMs are optional interaction backends, not authoritative planners

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21

Realtime multimodal LLMs may power live voice, video, interruption detection, meeting capture, discovery mode, pronunciation or activity feedback, and short-horizon task monitoring. They are interaction backends and perceptual/extraction aids, not the authoritative UbU planner.

Realtime model output must enter UbU as structured, provenance-bearing candidate updates. Examples include `ObservedEvent`, `UserInterruption`, `TaskProgressDelta`, `AffectSignal`, `PlanDeviation`, `ExternalConditionChange`, `ClarificationQuestion`, `WorkItemCandidate`, `LogEntryCandidate`, and `AssociationAttestationCandidate`.

UbU distinguishes **model-time awareness** from **planner-time semantics**. A realtime model may notice elapsed time, silence, overlapping speech, interruption, or a changing audiovisual scene. UbU's planner remains responsible for deciding whether that observation changes Task state, Calendar validity, Plan legitimacy, Logs, Objectives, or recalculation triggers.

Realtime operation requires explicit user-visible modes, such as passive/off, text-only, voice session, active discovery mode, meeting/logging mode, high-privacy local-only mode, and cloud-assisted mode. Continuous capture must not become covert surveillance or an implied authorization to mutate canonical state.

---

## UBU-D0133: LLMs are replaceable cognitive backends and structured outputs are candidate updates

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21

UbU should treat LLMs as replaceable cognitive backends. They may interpret, summarize, classify, translate, transcribe, propose structures, critique plans, call tools, generate UI drafts, and assist extraction. They do not own canonical truth, canonical value, canonical memory, or canonical planning state.

Strict schemas and structured outputs are necessary but not sufficient. A JSON object that satisfies a schema may still be semantically wrong, policy-invalid, Compartment-invalid, dependency-invalid, affect-invalid, stale, maliciously influenced, or unsupported by evidence.

The admission pipeline is therefore:

```text
LLM output
  -> schema validation
  -> semantic validation
  -> policy and Compartment validation
  -> provenance attachment
  -> conflict detection

---

## UBU-D0134: Context assembly is a privacy-relevant governed act

**Status:** Accepted

As LLM context windows grow, UbU must not assume that sending more context is automatically better. Context assembly is itself a privacy-relevant action that may cross Identity, Compartment, Association, provider, and retention boundaries.

A future `ContextBundle` should describe why context was assembled and what it exposed:

```text
ContextBundle
  - purpose
  - source object references
  - Compartments included
  - Identities exposed
  - Association references exposed
  - provider or model destination

---

## UBU-D0135: UbU should be both an MCP-style client and an MCP-style server with capability boundaries

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21

UbU should support MCP-style integration boundaries in both directions.

As a client, UbU can connect to external tools and data sources such as GitHub, calendars, email, local scripts, file stores, home automation, and model/agent services.

As a server, UbU may expose narrow, scoped, reviewable affordances to outside agents, such as:

- create candidate Task;
- read a current Plan summary;
- append or submit a Log candidate;
- request user clarification;
- submit a proposed Plan repair;
- query Objective status;
- submit a candidate AssociationAttestation;

---

## UBU-D0136: Delegated agency is first-class in planning

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21

UbU Tasks may be performed by the user, a local agent, a cloud agent, a tool, another human Identity, an Association, or a delegated coordinator. The executor is part of the planning problem and must not be hidden inside an opaque automation step.

A delegated Task should distinguish:

- Task intent;
- authorization source;
- executor;
- observer;
- reviewer;
- granted authority;
- expected output;
- completion evidence;

---

## UBU-D0137: Delegation Substrate is the near-term model for preparing Task delegation

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21

Use **Delegation Substrate** as the near-term tool/model for preparing Task delegation. It is not the full Skill Barter marketplace. It is the explicit representation that makes a Task ready to be performed, reviewed, or handed off by clarifying purpose, executor, authority, expected output, evidence, constraints, and completion criteria.

The Delegation Substrate is also valuable for Tasks the user intends to perform solo. Formalizing the same fields can act as a self-reminder of how and why the Task needs to be performed, what evidence would show completion, what authority is being used, and what constraints matter.

A minimum Delegation Substrate packet may include:

```text
DelegationPacket
  - Task or Objective reference
  - intended executor type
  - purpose / why this matters
  - expected output
  - authority granted or self-authority note

---

## UBU-D0138: General Contractor is a first-class delegated coordination role

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21

A **General Contractor** is an Identity, Agent, or Association delegated authority to coordinate multiple subordinate executors in order to satisfy an Objective or complete a Container of Tasks, subject to explicit authority, budget, privacy, review, evidence, and escalation constraints.

This role is distinct from an ordinary executor. A General Contractor may decompose work, assign subtasks, supervise human or agent executors, collect evidence, report status, and submit candidate updates. UbU must still model the General Contractor's authority as bounded and reviewable.

---

## UBU-D0139: Skill Barter marketplace is an outreach and future-market direction, not a Phase 1 marketplace commitment

**Status:** Accepted

The **Skill Barter marketplace** should be presented as a future marketplace direction and EthConf NYC outreach hook, especially for cypherpunk and privacy-oriented audiences. It signals that UbU preserves much of the original cryptocurrency ethos: voluntary coordination, sovereign identity, privacy, open markets, FOSS development, pseudonymous capability, and user-controlled settlement references where lawful.

Skill Barter can attract younger developers with drive, time, and interest in FOSS contribution by showing that UbU is not merely another productivity app. It is a coordination substrate that could eventually support privacy-preserving skilled-work exchange among human and agentic executors.

A mature Skill Barter marketplace would naturally create demand for FHE, ZK, secure compute, private reputation, private escrow-like commitments, selective disclosure, and other high-privacy technologies compatible with the future Ethereum ecosystem. This should remain an architectural and outreach signal, not a token-first or speculation-first positioning.

---

## UBU-D0140: Computer-use and background agents require authority, audit, rollback, and prompt-injection handling

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21

Computer-use agents and background agents are high-risk external actors, not ordinary pure functions. They may operate browsers, accounts, files, credentials, APIs, and external systems where prompt injection, irreversible side effects, disclosure, or stale assumptions can cause harm.

Future `AgentAction` or `BackgroundProcess` models should record:

```text
AgentAction / BackgroundProcess
  - executor Identity or agent reference
  - trigger or schedule
  - authority scope
  - credentials or integrations used
  - Compartment and Identity scope
  - external surface touched

---

## UBU-D0141: Local/on-device inference is a first-class execution tier

**Status:** Accepted

UbU should treat local and on-device inference as a first-class execution tier, not merely a fallback for unavailable cloud models. Local inference supports privacy, offline use, lower marginal cost, responsiveness, and user sovereignty.

A provisional execution hierarchy is:

```text
Tier 0: deterministic local code
Tier 1: small local/on-device model
Tier 2: user-owned desktop or worker model
Tier 3: user-selected cloud model via BYOK
Tier 4: optional UbUCorp-managed hosted service
```

Local models may handle first-pass extraction, privacy classification, simple message triage, candidate Task/Log creation, affect journaling summaries, and compartment routing. Cloud or larger models may be reserved for high-complexity planning, deep design review, organizational introspection over large archives, difficult ambiguity resolution, and expensive multimodal reasoning when policy allows.

---

## UBU-D0142: UbU UX should evolve into a state-transition cockpit

**Status:** Accepted

UbU should not be framed as chat plus calendar. The long-term UX should become a **state-transition cockpit**: a user interface that presents the current WorkItem, relevant state, candidate transitions, constraints, explanations, evidence, and review controls.

The Phase 1 one-next-Task UX remains the narrow proof. Later interfaces may adapt the visible control surface to the current state transition:

- reply to a message;
- choose or start the next Task;
- review a Log discrepancy;
- repair a Plan conflict;
- inspect a Delegation Substrate packet;
- approve or reject an agent action;
- review an AssociationAttestation;
- run organizational introspection;

---

## UBU-D0143: Community-specific EthConf briefs are derived presentation layers

**Status:** Accepted

UbU should maintain a small set of community-specific derived documents for EthConf and adjacent outreach when the audience has a materially different trust barrier, motivation, or call to action.

The durable derived audience documents are:

- `README.md` for upcoming technical contributors and technically serious readers who need the project entry point;
- `OUTREACH.md` for FOSS maintainers and general software engineers who may become technical contributors;
- `PM_BRIEF.md` for project leads, technical PMs, protocol leads, release coordinators, and people coordinating autonomous contributors;
- `FUNDER_BRIEF.md` for grantmakers, sponsors, hackathon judges, aligned funders, and prototype funders;
- `SOVEREIGN_COORDINATION.md` for cypherpunks, privacy engineers, Ethereum privacy builders, FHE/ZK/secure-compute researchers, and sovereign-coordination audiences;
- `ORG_INTROSPECTION_BRIEF.md` for mission-driven projects, FOSS maintainers, nonprofits, DAOs, foundations, and teams that want evidence-backed mission alignment.

These files are presentation layers. They must not introduce new design authority. Their source of truth remains `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`.

---

## UBU-D0144: Inter-instance protocol is a generic envelope family with worker API profiles

**Status:** Accepted

UbU should have one generic inter-instance protocol family for communication between UbU instances, worker-mode instances, and future compatible peers. The protocol is a family of typed envelopes with shared authority, provenance, Compartment, identity, idempotency, versioning, and review semantics, not one undifferentiated endpoint that treats every payload as the same kind of action.

The protocol should eventually support at least these payload families:

- contextual messages and Message Context Envelopes;
- worker assignments and assignment responses;
- status updates and check-ins;
- mutation requests and projection requests;
- capability grant issuance, acknowledgement, rotation, and revocation;
- External Event submission;
- Snapshot or Log candidate submission where authorized;
- recalculation requests;

---

## UBU-D0145: Phase 1 risk reports are derived artifacts, not canonical risk objects

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §28

Risk reports in MVP are derived, recalculable analyses over Calendars, Plans, Tasks, Logs, Snapshots, External Events, worker status, External References, and compact Calendar metadata. Risk remains reportable state, not a first-class canonical object.

The Phase 1 MVP risk-report set is:

- `p90_completion_time`;
- `critical_path`;
- `deadline_miss_probability`;
- `affect_constraint_violation_probability`;
- `low_compact_calendar_coverage_warning`;
- `dependency_fragility`;
- `worker_or_automation_bottleneck`;
- `stale_affect_warning`;
- `destructive_pressure_warning`;
- `post_plan_depletion_warning`.

Additional findings may be computed when source data is already available, but they are not required Phase 1 reports: relationship-maintenance neglect, preference uncertainty, repeated override or deviation patterns, motivation mismatch, stale or missing discovery-mode reconciliation, and overdue Calendar preview or Log review.

Risk reports are computed on demand from the current Calendar or Plan. Implementations may cache a risk-report artifact with a Calendar, Plan, run artifact, release package, or UI view for auditability and performance. Cached reports are derived state and must be invalidated or marked stale when relevant Tasks, Logs, Snapshots, External Events, worker status, compact Calendar coverage, or recalculation triggers change.

Automation Workers may compute or refresh risk-report artifacts only through explicit capability grants. Worker-produced risk reports are advisory until admitted by the canonical instance. Workers may submit report artifacts, refresh requests, mutation requests, or projection requests according to authority; they do not create canonical Risk objects or directly mutate Tasks.

Risk reports may recommend follow-up Tasks or submit Task candidates through the normal request/review path, but they must not silently create canonical Tasks in MVP. Typical follow-ups include clarification, affect collection, dependency repair, worker retry or escalation, Calendar regeneration, Log review, Calendar preview, and GitHub projection or reconciliation.

Risk reporting is part of UbU-runs-UbU release ceremonies. Release readiness and Release Outreach Pipeline packages should include deadline risk, critical path, dependency fragility, worker or automation bottleneck, and low coverage warnings when inputs exist, while respecting Compartment, Identity, export, and public-projection boundaries.

UbU's PERT-superiority demonstration should be precise: Phase 1 should not claim to replace every PERT use. It should show that UbU handles the planning dimensions PERT leaves out: explicit preconditions and UniverseState, affect constraints, worker status, compact Calendar coverage, recalculation from Logs and Snapshots, and actionable Plan repair or next-Task recommendations.

---

## UBU-D0146: Phase 1 recalculation triggers use logged trigger records

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §29

Recalculation triggers are explicit event-like records that tell UbU when a Calendar, Plan, risk-report cache, explanation cache, or next-action recommendation may no longer reflect the current modeled state. A trigger is not a separate canonical domain mutation by itself; it references the Log entry, Snapshot, External Event, worker request, or clock condition that changed the planner's inputs.

The Phase 1 trigger kinds are:

- `task_completed`;
- `task_failed`;
- `task_moot`;
- `observed_snapshot`;
- `affect_confidence_decay`;
- `external_event`;
- `github_update`;
- `user_override`;
- `calendar_preview_due`;
- `log_review_due`;
- `discovery_mode_reconciliation_due`;
- `elapsed_time`;
- `low_compact_calendar_coverage`;
- `worker_request`.

Phase 1 user feedback controls such as snooze, reject, decompose, and override should be represented through ordinary Task, Log, or user-override payloads rather than separate trigger kinds unless implementation evidence shows that a distinct trigger kind is required.

Phase 2 trigger kinds are limited to sync and personal-worker conditions that can invalidate a local Calendar: `sync_state_changed`, `device_reconnected`, `remote_worker_status_changed`, and `offline_window_changed`. These belong with multi-device local-first sync and user-owned worker coordination.

Post-MVP trigger families include native cross-user message arrival, AssociationAttestation review, broad legacy-message ingestion, background AgentAction policy events, external compute budget or provider changes, and other high-level agentic or multi-user coordination events.

Accepted Phase 1 triggers are logged using the existing Log event type `recalculation_triggered`. The event payload should include `trigger_kind`, `scope`, `target_refs`, `source_event_refs`, `requested_action`, `batch_key`, `reason`, and optional `idempotency_key`. `requested_action` is either `recalculate_now` or `mark_calendar_stale`.

Automation Workers cannot directly create canonical triggers. A worker with the `recalculation.request` capability may submit a recalculation request. The canonical instance validates capability, target scope, Compartment/export policy, source evidence, and idempotency before recording an accepted `recalculation_triggered` Log entry or a rejected worker request/mutation Log entry.

Triggers may be batched when they share the same Calendar or Plan scope and no trigger in the batch requires user-visible immediate repair before the batch window closes. Batching must preserve each source reference and reason. A short event-loop batch is acceptable for multiple imported GitHub events, worker updates, or stale markers.

Immediate recalculation is required when the trigger can change the current or next recommended Task, hard feasibility, Task lifecycle state, dependency or precondition truth, Objective status, affect legitimacy, worker assignment needed for current work, or compact Calendar coverage below the configured minimum.

Default Phase 1 immediate triggers are:

- `task_completed`, `task_failed`, and `task_moot` for current, planned, dependency-relevant, or Objective-relevant Tasks;
- `user_override`;
- planner-relevant `observed_snapshot`;
- planner-relevant `external_event`;
- planner-relevant `github_update`;
- `low_compact_calendar_coverage`;
- urgent accepted `worker_request`.

Stale marking is sufficient when the trigger only means cached Plans, Calendars, explanations, or reports must be refreshed before later reliance. Default stale-only triggers are:

- `calendar_preview_due`;
- `log_review_due`;
- `discovery_mode_reconciliation_due`;
- `elapsed_time` outside the reactive repair envelope;
- `affect_confidence_decay` that has not crossed a configured planning threshold or current affect constraint;
- low-priority `external_event` or `github_update` observations that do not affect the current Plan.

`elapsed_time` is materialized only when crossing a modeled boundary such as Task start or end, Static Task proximity, review due time, stale-affect threshold, reactive horizon expiry, offline precompute boundary, or compact Calendar expiration. It does not create continuous clock-tick Log entries.

---

## UBU-D0147: Moot reason codes are a closed MVP enum

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9.5

`moot` remains a first-class terminal Task status that is functionally equivalent to completion for planning but distinct for logs, reporting, audit, and user review. Every Task transition to `moot` requires a reason code.

The Phase 1 MVP moot reason-code enum is:

- `externally_satisfied`;
- `superseded`;
- `delegated`;
- `no_longer_relevant`;
- `invalidated_by_universe_change`;
- `replaced_by_new_plan_structure`;
- `user_declared_moot`;
- `automation_obsolete`;
- `duplicate`.

This list is sufficient for MVP. It covers externally completed work, supersession, delegation, user-directed closure, world-state invalidation, plan-structure replacement, obsolete automation output, and duplicate imported or generated work. Additional nuance belongs in the `task_moot` Log entry's notes, reason text, provenance, External References, or correction/annotation entries rather than in ad hoc canonical codes.

`duplicate` is included because duplicate Tasks are common when importing GitHub Issues, PRs, comments, fixtures, worker outputs, or decomposed work. Duplicate closure must remain queryable and auditable rather than being collapsed into generic supersession.

`delegated` is separate from `externally_satisfied`. `delegated` means this Task is no longer assigned to this executor because responsibility moved to another executor, worker, Identity, Association, or delegation path. It does not assert that the underlying Objective or required world state is already satisfied. `externally_satisfied` means the required state became true through another action, observation, import, or external event.

Reason codes are enum-only in MVP. Implementations may accept human-readable notes and implementation-local diagnostic labels, but canonical `moot_reason_code` values must be one of the accepted enum values. New canonical reason codes require an explicit schema migration or accepted decision.

Selection guidance:

- use `externally_satisfied` when the required state is already true;
- use `superseded` when a newer Task, Objective, decision, or source artifact replaces this Task;
- use `delegated` when responsibility moved to another executor and will be tracked elsewhere;
- use `no_longer_relevant` when the Task is no longer useful but not invalidated by the world;
- use `invalidated_by_universe_change` when an external state change made the Task wrong or impossible;
- use `replaced_by_new_plan_structure` when decomposition, regrouping, or restructuring replaced this Task while preserving the underlying intent;
- use `user_declared_moot` when the user explicitly says the Task is moot and no more specific code applies;
- use `automation_obsolete` when worker or automation state makes generated work obsolete;
- use `duplicate` when another active, completed, or canonical work item already represents the same work.

## UBU-D0148: Task-to-Container mutation preserves Task identity as history

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9.4

A Task does not literally change type into a Container by reusing its handle. Task-to-Container mutation is modeled as a structural replacement: the original Task remains an immutable historical Task record, a new Container is created with a new `container_id`, and the original Task transitions to `moot` when the restructuring replaces it for planning.

The Container records lineage back to the original Task through fields or metadata such as `origin_task_ref`, `mutation_reason`, `mutation_log_ref`, child WorkItem refs, and provenance. The original Task handle remains valid for Logs, External References, Plan history, projection history, and audit. It must not be reused as the Container handle.

All new child Tasks created during decomposition, preemption, retry, or worker expansion receive new Task handles. Existing Tasks may be grouped under the Container by reference when appropriate, but grouping does not rewrite their handles. A continuation child may inherit user-facing title context from the original Task, but it is still a new Task with its own lifecycle.

Intent-level fields stay on the Container or lineage metadata: title or summary, served Objective refs, parent or dependency context, external-reference lineage, Compartment/security labels, authority/provenance, and explanatory notes about why the work was split. Action-level fields belong on child Tasks: duration or duration PDF, preconditions, effects, executor/delegation fields, worker assignment/status, expected output, evidence requirements, child-specific dependencies, and child-specific deadlines.

Child Tasks may inherit or narrow Objective refs, Compartment refs, authority source, relevant External Reference context, and non-sensitive notes when those remain valid for the child. They do not silently inherit stale status, completion evidence, modeled effects, worker status, or projection state from the original Task.

The default original-Task lifecycle transition for decomposition or regrouping is `moot` with reason code `replaced_by_new_plan_structure`. Use narrower accepted moot codes when more accurate: `delegated` when responsibility moves out of the executor scope without decomposition, `superseded` when a newer Task, Objective, decision, or source artifact replaces the Task, and `duplicate` when another canonical work item already represents the same work.

External IDs are preserved through External References, not by reusing WorkItem handles. When an external object such as a GitHub Issue represents the whole unit of work, it should link to the Container. When the same external object supports or evidences a specific child Task, child-level External References may also be created with the appropriate relation type. The original Task's historical External References remain intact; new references express the replacement or child relationship rather than rewriting history.

For GitHub-linked Tasks, decomposition should keep the GitHub Issue or PR traceable to the Container and project only clearly marked child-level status when needed. GitHub projection and reconciliation use External References to decide whether the external object represents the Container, a child Task, or both.

Automation Worker child Tasks are ordinary child Tasks grouped under a Container, with worker/delegation metadata and capability boundaries. Workers may propose Task-to-Container restructuring only through authorized mutation requests. The canonical instance validates authority, expected prior version, Compartment/export policy, External Reference changes, and idempotency, then writes applied or rejected Log entries.

## UBU-D0149: Objective status transitions are mode-specific and logged

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §7.3

Objective status transitions are constrained by Objective mode. One-time Objectives and evergreen Objectives share the same status enum, but not every status is valid for every mode.

For one-time Objectives, valid statuses are `active`, `completed`, `abandoned`, `invalid`, and `superseded`. `satisfied` is not valid for one-time Objectives. Legal one-time transitions are:

```text
active -> completed
active -> abandoned
active -> invalid
active -> superseded
completed -> invalid
completed -> superseded
abandoned -> invalid
abandoned -> superseded
superseded -> invalid
```

`completed`, `abandoned`, and `superseded` are terminal for normal one-time planning. A completed one-time Objective does not reactivate. If the user later wants the same kind of outcome again, UbU should model that as a new Objective or as an explicit supersession, not as `completed -> active`.

For evergreen Objectives, valid statuses are `active`, `satisfied`, `abandoned`, `invalid`, and `superseded`. `completed` is not valid for evergreen Objectives. Legal evergreen transitions are:

```text
active -> satisfied
active -> abandoned
active -> invalid
active -> superseded
satisfied -> active
satisfied -> abandoned
satisfied -> invalid
satisfied -> superseded
abandoned -> invalid
abandoned -> superseded
superseded -> invalid
```

`abandoned` and `superseded` are terminal for normal evergreen planning. If an abandoned or superseded evergreen concern later becomes relevant again, UbU should usually create or select a new Objective rather than silently reactivating the old one.

`invalid` may occur from any Objective status and is terminal. It means the Objective record should not participate in normal planning because it is malformed, impossible, contradictory, forbidden by mode rules, or admitted by mistake. `invalid` is not a user preference to stop pursuing an otherwise valid Objective; that is `abandoned`.

`superseded` may occur from any non-`invalid` Objective status. It means a newer Objective, decision, import result, or source artifact has replaced the Objective for planning and traceability. Supersession should preserve lineage to the replacement Objective or source when known.

`abandoned` does not occur from any state. It is legal only from `active` one-time Objectives and from `active` or `satisfied` evergreen Objectives. It represents a user-authoritative or authority-source-authorized decision to stop pursuing an otherwise valid Objective.

Evergreen `satisfied -> active` reactivation is a canonical transition only when the accepted current state changes through user declaration, authorized observation/import, or elapsed-time recurrence evaluation. Hypothetical Plan simulation may predict that an evergreen Objective will become active in a future branch, but simulation alone does not mutate canonical Objective status.

Every accepted canonical Objective status transition creates an append-only Log entry with event type `objective_transitioned`, including old status, new status, actor or authority source, reason, effective time, and provenance when available. Simulated status changes inside candidate Plans or risk reports are predictions, not canonical transitions, and do not create `objective_transitioned` Logs unless accepted as actual state.

## UBU-D0150: Model-committee v0.2 adopts schema-native Claude Code cross-scoring

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

`model-committee v0.2` extends the v0.1 bootstrap loop by adding Claude Code CLI as a second frontier provider for both proposal generation and scoring.

This is a contract-level version change, not a small provider addition. v0.1 remains the narrow baseline, but v0.2 updates the dogfooding architecture to make disagreement between independent frontier providers visible, reviewable, and useful.

v0.2 scope includes:

- Claude Code CLI as a second frontier work and score provider;
- schema-native Claude Code structured output using `--json-schema`;
- cross-scoring between frontier providers;
- a first-class score matrix in run manifests and review artifacts;
- disagreement flags in `review.md`;
- a Claude Code config block;
- updated quorum rules;
- `doctor` checks for Claude availability and structured-output support;
- final operator-run artifact-publication instructions targeting `../model-committee-artifacts`.

v0.2 remains out of scope for:

- multi-turn Claude Code sessions;
- GitHub API integration;
- adaptive model weights;
- full Association automation;
- UbU planning-kernel work;
- automatic artifact push, merge, PR creation, or canonical design-state mutation.

Claude Code should be invoked as a subprocess provider, not through direct Anthropic API calls made by `model-committee` itself. The provider/network policy distinction is explicit:

- `model-committee` must not directly call Anthropic APIs;
- `model-committee` may invoke approved external CLI subprocesses when explicitly enabled by configuration;
- those provider CLIs may perform their own network/API calls according to their upstream authentication, billing, and policy configuration;
- every provider invocation must be logged with provider ID, model name or alias, argv shape, timeout, exit code, stdout/stderr artifact paths, schema-validation result, and relevant usage/cost metadata when available.

The installed Claude Code CLI version for the v0.2 target environment is confirmed as `2.1.146`, and that version supports `--json-schema`. Therefore Claude Code should use schema-native structured output as the primary path rather than Ollama-style JSON extraction.

The Claude Code provider should parse validated structured output from the CLI JSON envelope. When `--output-format json` and `--json-schema` are used, the schema-conforming payload should be read from `structured_output` rather than from free-form text. Prompt-embedded JSON extraction is only a compatibility fallback if a future environment lacks working schema-native output.

Claude tool authority must be restricted explicitly. For scripted schema-output runs, the default should be no tools or the narrowest necessary tool set. If file inspection is needed, use `--tools Read`. Do not rely on `--allowedTools` alone as a sandbox boundary, because allowing a tool without prompting is not the same as restricting the available tool set.

Cross-scoring rules:

- Codex scores Claude-authored proposals.
- Claude Code scores Codex-authored proposals.
- A provider's self-score may be retained as diagnostic metadata, but it does not count as quorum evidence.
- Local/Ollama providers remain useful for diversity, dissent, fallback, and offline review, but they do not replace the required frontier cross-score unless a later decision expands quorum policy.
- Score results should be stored as matrix entries with `proposal_id`, `author_provider`, `scorer_provider`, score, validity, rationale, risks, and required fixes.

v0.2 automated selection requires:

- at least one valid work proposal;
- at least one valid cross-score from a different frontier provider;
- no hard validation failures on the selected patch;
- no critical disagreement flag unless an explicit manual override mechanism is used outside automatic selection.

Default disagreement and review thresholds:

- frontier score gap of 25 or more points: human review required;
- selected score below 70: human review required;
- any selected patch validation failure: no selection;
- no valid cross-score from a different frontier provider: no automated selection.

v0.2 should add a distinct human-review-required exit code, provisionally `9`, for quorum or disagreement outcomes that are not the same failure mode as v0.1's invalid selected patch exit code `7`.

The generated `review.md` should include a final operator step to publish the run artifact to the sibling artifact repository:

```bash
RUN_ID="<run-id>"

mkdir -p ../model-committee-artifacts/runs
cp -r "$(pwd)/runs/${RUN_ID}" ../model-committee-artifacts/runs/

git -C ../model-committee-artifacts add "runs/${RUN_ID}"
git -C ../model-committee-artifacts commit -S -m "UMC artifact ${RUN_ID}"
git -C ../model-committee-artifacts push
```

These commands are instructions for a human operator or separately authorized release process. `model-committee v0.2` should generate them, not execute them automatically.

## UBU-D0151: Compact Calendar MVP grammar uses skeleton, legitimization, bounded candidates, and repair metadata

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§15.2.2, 16

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0016`.

Compact Calendar planning for Phase 1 uses a staged explicit grammar rather than a bare DFS grammar.

The minimum skeleton Plan representation includes:

- Static Task placements with fixed start and end times;
- dependency DAG frontier for the current planning scope;
- prerequisite roots whose required state is not already true in the initial UniverseState;
- ordered prerequisite chains with dependency and precondition references;
- initial UniverseState assumptions, including known true, known false, assumed, and unresolved planner-relevant facts;
- unsatisfied dependency diagnostics with failing Task, missing state, causal chain, and clarification alternatives where available.

Skeleton generation must check the initial UniverseState before inserting a prerequisite Task. A dependency requires a state, not necessarily a new Task. If skeletonization cannot produce a viable baseline, ordinary planning stops and UbU reports a concrete diagnostic instead of continuing into optimization.

Legitimization adds the minimum human-viability constraints and support work required to make the skeleton plausible for execution:

- affect constraints in `user_mode`;
- recovery, break, meal, sleep, and rest requirements when applicable;
- transition buffers;
- setup and teardown time;
- context-switch limits;
- slack and dependency-fragility thresholds.

The legitimized skeleton baseline is the minimum feasible Plan. Support work inserted by legitimization is represented as ordinary Tasks or buffers with explanation lineage, not as hidden planner magic.

The minimum candidate Plan representation after legitimization includes:

- materialized Task placements;
- decision envelopes for movable Tasks;
- Plan probability metadata;
- value score;
- legitimacy threshold result or score;
- hard-validation status;
- explanation lineage back to Objectives, dependencies, preconditions, affect constraints, worker status, risk findings, and probability inputs.

Execution profiles are allowed as follows:

- `baseline`: greedy mean-duration planning is required as a benchmark and fallback reference.
- `mobile_local`: deterministic skeletonization, conservative legitimization, exact hard-constraint checks, local repair recipes, basic decision envelopes, cached explanations, and short-horizon BFS-like branch or repair reconstruction are required.
- `desktop_or_worker`: DFS-like candidate construction, local search, larger branch horizons, cached subplans, and solver-backed finalist validation are allowed.
- `solver_validation`: CP-SAT, SMT/MaxSMT, local-search, or comparable exact/conservative solvers may validate finalists, diagnose contradictions, or certify hard constraints.
- `gpu_or_hosted`: GPU-friendly scoring, stochastic simulation, affect scoring, robustness scoring, and learned-model inference may propose or rank candidates, but exact or conservative validation must certify selected Plans.

Search methods are implementation techniques, not semantic authority. DFS-like, BFS-like, greedy, solver-backed, GPU-friendly, and local repair methods may be combined as long as hard constraints, explanations, and selected-Plan validity remain inspectable.

Plan probability is represented as probability metadata with:

- a scalar display probability;
- a log probability for stable computation;
- an optional probability interval;
- a provenance expression over modeled probabilistic inputs;
- correlation-group, scenario, joint-distribution, or shared-random-variable references when inputs are not independent.

Implementations must not multiply probabilistic inputs unless independence is explicitly declared by the model. Correlated or unknown relationships must use joint scenarios, shared random variables, correlation groups, or conservative intervals rather than pretending independence. MVP may be conservative and mark correlation unknown instead of producing false precision.

Compact Calendar encoding should include, when present in the planning scope:

- skeleton Plan metadata;
- legitimized skeleton baseline;
- ordering constraints;
- duration PDFs;
- Task success probabilities;
- external-event and interruption distributions;
- affect constraints;
- decision envelopes;

## UBU-D0152: Extrospection is first-class Relationship review

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§2.10.1, 22

Extrospection is a first-class Relationship review feature. It applies the evidence-backed attestation pattern used by introspection and AssociationAttestation to the user's Relationship model.

Relationships have **epistemic asymmetry**: the user has first-person access to the user's own declarations and experiences, while UbU can only maintain evidence-backed hypotheses about another party's perspective. Extrospection must therefore target the user's counterparty-perspective hypotheses, Relationship scopes, trust assumptions, reciprocity assumptions, affective impact, and functionality assumptions. It must not claim authoritative access to another person's inner state.

Extrospection should present evidence in tension rather than deliver an oracle verdict. It may surface confirming evidence, disconfirming evidence, ambiguity, insufficient evidence, clarification prompts, possible model updates, and introspection handoffs. The goal is evidence-backed confrontation and self-governance, not counterparty prosecution.

---

## UBU-D0153: Relationship perspectives, extrospection findings, and evidence policy are structured and reviewable

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§22.1, 22.2

The richer Relationship model should lazily decompose the user's side into:

- `ownDeclaredPerspectiveHistory`;
- `ownObservedBehaviorRefs`;
- `ownAffectHistoryRefs`;
- `ownReflections`.

User declarations about a Relationship are versioned over time, not overwritten as a single timeless field.

Counterparty perspective should be represented as domain- and scope-tagged `counterpartyPerspectiveHypotheses`, not as a monolithic `speculatedPerspective`. UbU may detect internal tension among those hypotheses as a finding about the user's model consistency, not as a claim about the counterparty.

Extrospection assessments should be separated into `ScopeAssessment`, `BoundaryAssessment`, `ReciprocityAssessment`, `TrustCalibrationAssessment`, `AffectiveAssessment`, and `FunctionalityAssessment`. `ScopeAssessment` logically precedes the others. Negative affect is not equivalent to dysfunction, and reviewed value-aligned discomfort may be recorded as `userAcceptedDiscomfort`.

Extrospection findings use the lifecycle `candidate`, `deferred`, `resurfaced`, `reviewed_accepted`, `reviewed_rejected`, `superseded`, and `archived`. Unreviewed findings must not silently update durable Relationship state. Rejected findings should be retained enough to suppress repeated bad framings.

Durable evidence should prefer Compartment-aware `EvidenceRef`s, selectors, summaries, typed retention policy, typed redaction policy, and EvidenceUsePolicy over copied private excerpts. Cross-Relationship inference is prohibited by default. Evidence should decay in salience unless reactivated by new evidence, user review, or a current Objective.

---

## UBU-D0154: RelationshipScopeTransition is an Objective target, not a separate planning system

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§7.5, 22.3

Users may explicitly create Objectives to change their own participation in a Relationship, invite or test a mutual scope change, or clarify whether another party is willing to enter a different scope.

`RelationshipScopeTransition` is a semantic target/reference for such Objectives. It is implemented through ordinary Objectives, Techniques, Steps, Tasks, Logs, extrospection reviews, introspection reviews, and UniverseState mutations. UbU should not create a parallel relationship-planning system.

The Relationship object remains primarily descriptive, but it keeps reverse references to active, completed, abandoned, declined, or superseded RelationshipScopeTransitions that affected it. This prevents declaration history from appearing to change spontaneously when a scope change resulted from a deliberate Objective.

Valid RelationshipScopeTransition work targets user-controlled behavior: disclosures, invitations, boundary-setting, availability changes, communication changes, and clarification attempts. Counterparty feelings, decisions, and Identity remain autonomous and uncertain.

---

## UBU-D0155: RelationshipScopeTransition separates process success from outcome and blocks optimized persuasion semantics

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§7.5, 22.3

Consent-dependent and mutual RelationshipScopeTransitions must separate `process_success_criteria` from `outcome_observations`. A transition attempt can be process-successful even when the counterparty declines. Counterparty response is evidence, not the user's success or failure.

The `transition_type` enum is provisionally:

- `unilateral`;
- `exploratory`;
- `mutual`;
- `retroactive_scope_clarification`.

All actionable Steps and Tasks must be anchored to user-controlled behavior. A Step is malformed if its completion criterion requires a counterparty mental state, feeling, or decision.

RelationshipScopeTransition Techniques should satisfy epistemic transparency: the counterparty should receive accurate information sufficient for autonomous decision-making. Exploratory transitions follow a single-iteration rule: one disclosure or proposal, one clarification if ambiguous, and termination of the current Objective on authentic refusal. Future reopening requires materially new evidence, a new Objective, and stronger review.

The prohibited-strategy taxonomy is typed and includes artificial urgency, false scarcity, vulnerability exploitation, incremental boundary erosion, strategic information withholding, emotional state manipulation, leveraging privileged affect knowledge, manufactured dependency, social pressure through third parties, retaliation or threat, coercive leverage, deceptive self-presentation, and repeated pursuit after refusal.

The affect-knowledge firewall is canonical: extrospection-derived affect knowledge may be used for harm avoidance, not persuasion optimization. Romantic, professional, dependency-heavy, and power-asymmetric transitions may carry stronger default advisory safeguards, including power/vulnerability checks, pacing constraints, and graceful nonachievement paths.

---

## UBU-D0156: Relationship safeguards are default-on advisory unless structural boundaries apply

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§2.10.2, 22.4, 23.3

Relationship-transition ethical reasoning, extrospection checks, introspection checks, manipulation-risk review, TrustCalibrationAssessment, power/vulnerability checks, pacing checks, and graceful nonachievement planning are wise default-on safeguards. Users should generally use them. However, UbU's prime directive is to respect the user's autonomy and decisions, so these behavioral-risk safeguards must not be unconditional hard gates by default.

Hard boundaries should be limited to structurally enforceable product invariants and explicit policies, including:

- Compartment boundaries;
- privacy policy;
- data-access authorization;
- EvidenceUsePolicy restrictions;
- export prohibitions;
- identity/Compartment isolation;
- provenance integrity;
- audit-record integrity;
- integration authorization;
- unavoidable provider/platform/legal constraints.

Behavioral-risk checks such as manipulation, coercion, harassment, stalking, deception, romantic/professional power asymmetry, rumination, and relationship-transition ethics depend on fallible classification. Treating them as hard gates risks false positives that block legitimate actions, false negatives that create misplaced trust, and a false impression that UbU can reliably prevent misuse or illegal behavior.

Behavioral safeguards should generally be default-on, user-aware, uncertainty-transparent, user-overrideable advisory checks with introspection consequences when bypassed. A user may configure some advisory checks as self-imposed required gates. Bypassing or disabling recommended safeguards is itself introspection-relevant evidence about revealed priorities and possible conflicts with declared values.

## UBU-D0157: LLM provider routing uses provider descriptors and policy-gated route decisions

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.11

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0060`.

UbU resolves external/cloud LLM routing through a provider-neutral descriptor plus a policy-gated route decision. Local Ollama-style providers, user-configured BYOK cloud APIs, user-owned remote workers, optional UbUCorp managed inference, and future compatible providers are all represented as LLM providers, but their trust boundaries remain explicit.

The minimum `LLMProviderDescriptor` records `provider_id`, `provider_class`, `endpoint_or_worker_ref`, execution location, operator, region or jurisdiction when known, supported models, modalities, context window, structured-output and tool-use capability, safety behavior, retention/training/disclosure profile, cost and rate-limit metadata, credential reference kind, default-enabled state, and user-visible name. The Phase 1 provider classes are `local_process`, `byok_cloud_api`, `user_owned_worker`, `ubucorp_managed_gateway`, and `third_party_compatible`.

Every provider adapter exposes the same narrow interface: list available models and capabilities, estimate cost and context fit, prepare a minimized request, invoke or stream completion, cancel when supported, and return usage, provider, model, and provenance metadata. The adapter interface normalizes execution mechanics only. It must not hide whether a request stays local, goes to a user-owned worker, or crosses a cloud/provider boundary.

An `LLMRouteRequest` records purpose, actor Identity, related Task/Objective/workflow refs, required capabilities, candidate provider policy, cost and latency limits, ContextBundle or source refs, required output schema when any, review requirement, and requested advisory use. An `LLMRouteDecision` records selected provider and model, boundary classification, Compartment policy result, minimization and redaction summary, estimated cost, disclosure text, approval state, and Log refs for allowed or denied routing.

Compartment policy is a hard upper bound on routing. `no_cloud_llm` content cannot be sent to cloud provider classes, including BYOK cloud APIs, UbUCorp managed gateways, or third-party compatible cloud providers. `no_external_export` content cannot be sent to external providers, remote workers, managed gateways, or third-party services except as redacted structural references that expose no protected payload. `local_only` content is limited to eligible local Devices and local providers. A capability grant, provider preference, workflow setting, or user click cannot override these denials.

Cloud routing requires context minimization before invocation. The route should use a `ContextBundle` or equivalent envelope that records purpose, source refs, Compartment refs, Identity and Association refs exposed, destination provider, model ref, data categories exposed, redaction policy, minimization notes, retention policy, user-visible summary, creation time, expiry when applicable, and downstream candidate refs. Raw payload should be replaced by references, summaries, hashes, or redacted structural fields whenever the task can still be performed.

BYOK credentials are credential references, not provider metadata payload. Secrets must not appear in provider descriptors, prompts, ContextBundles, Logs, or exported artifacts. Credential references may be scoped by provider, account, model family, Identity, Compartment, workflow, cost budget, and Device or worker. The default storage target is the local instance or OS/device secret store; a user-owned worker may hold a credential only when explicitly configured. Rotation and revocation preserve audit continuity through credential version refs without exposing the secret.

UbUCorp managed inference is represented as a provider class, not as a mandatory dependency or privileged protocol path. It uses the same descriptor, route request, route decision, Compartment gates, disclosure, provenance, cost controls, and output admission pipeline as any other cloud provider. The FOSS core must remain local-capable, BYOK-capable, self-hostable, and useful when UbUCorp managed inference is unavailable.

Any workflow using a cloud or external LLM must disclose, before or at execution time, the provider, model or model class, operator, local-vs-cloud status, destination region when known, whether BYOK or UbUCorp-managed credentials are used, data categories and Compartments exposed, retention/training profile, estimated cost when available, and that output is advisory until admitted through UbU validation and review. Approval may be per-run, per-session, per-workflow, or policy-based only when Compartment policy allows it.

**Consequences:**

- LLM routing can proceed without privileging Ollama, UbUCorp, or any single cloud API as the canonical interface.
- `UBU-Q0079`, `UBU-Q0080`, `UBU-Q0083`, and `UBU-Q0084` may depend on this routing boundary while still refining MCP tools, Delegation Substrate fields, ContextBundle governance, and background-agent policy.
- Provider-specific SDK details, exact secret-store implementation, and long-context bundle review UX may evolve without changing the minimum boundary.

## UBU-D0158: Phase 1 worker work discovery uses explicit assignments

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §25.1.2

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0008`.

Phase 1 worker work discovery uses explicit assignment by the parent UbU instance. Workers may poll a parent-specific assignment inbox or receive pushed notifications, but the inbox contains only work already offered or assigned to that worker Identity. Worker check-ins may advertise health, availability, local resource state, and capability metadata so the parent can select an eligible worker; they are not an open task-claim, work-stealing, bidding, or marketplace mechanism.

A worker assignment is a scoped execution lease binding one Task or Delegation Substrate packet to one worker Identity for one active executor slot. The minimum assignment record includes `assignment_id`, parent instance ref, `task_ref`, worker Identity ref, capability grant ref, assigned-by Identity or authority source, assignment status, lease or heartbeat deadline, expected output summary, review requirement, idempotency key, and provenance. Assignment handoffs that expose protected or low-security content must also reference the relevant Compartment decision or ContextBundle.

The minimum Phase 1 assignment statuses are `offered`, `accepted`, `in_progress`, `clarification_requested`, `delivered`, `completed`, `rejected_by_worker`, `cancelled`, `expired`, and `failed`. Assignment status does not replace Task status. A delivered assignment is awaiting parent review; a completed assignment means the canonical instance accepted the outcome or determined that no more worker action is required.

Multiple workers may observe the same Task only through explicit read grants, observer roles, or separate review assignments. Observation does not confer execution authority. Only one worker may hold the active execution lease for a given executor slot on a Task in Phase 1. If parallel work is needed, UbU should model separate child Tasks or separate named assignment roles rather than allowing multiple workers to compete for the same Task. Competitive worker claiming and marketplace-style bidding are deferred.

Every assignment lifecycle transition is logged. This decision extends the Phase 1 Log event-type set with `worker_assignment_updated`. Its payload records the assignment id, old and new status when applicable, worker Identity, Task ref, capability grant ref, lease deadline, reason, evidence refs, idempotency key, and whether recalculation was requested. Assignment events that affect the current or next recommended Task, worker bottleneck risk, or Plan feasibility create or batch a `recalculation_triggered` Log entry using the existing trigger taxonomy.

Workers may reject assignments by returning `rejected_by_worker` with a reason and evidence when relevant. Rejection does not mutate the Task directly. The canonical instance decides whether to reassign, ask the user, mark the Task blocked, revise the Delegation Substrate packet, or leave the Task available for manual work.

If a worker disappears mid-Task, the parent marks the assignment `expired` after the heartbeat or lease deadline, logs the transition, and treats the Task as unresolved unless separate accepted evidence proves completion or mootness. Late worker submissions after expiration are stale by default and must pass expected-prior-version, idempotency, authority, and review checks before they can affect canonical state. The parent may then reassign the Task, create a retry or repair Task, request clarification, or surface the worker bottleneck in risk reporting. Retry construction is defined by `UBU-D0187`.

Workers may request clarification through assignment status or an authorized mutation/request payload. The canonical instance may convert the request into a clarification Task, user prompt, revised assignment packet, or rejection of the request. Workers may propose child Tasks or Task-to-Container restructuring only through authorized mutation requests; approved restructuring follows the accepted Task-to-Container and child Task semantics. Workers do not directly create canonical child Tasks in Phase 1.

**Consequences:**

- Assignment is parent-directed and audit-oriented; worker polling is only a delivery mechanism for explicit assignments.
- Phase 1 avoids competitive worker claiming while preserving future compatibility with richer delegation, General Contractor, and Skill Barter workflows.
- Worker disappearance, rejection, clarification, and child-Task proposals are handled through logged assignment transitions and mutation/request review rather than direct canonical writes.
- Delegation Substrate details remain open in `UBU-Q0080`.

## UBU-D0159: GitHub projection writes only managed surfaces and reconciles drift

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0002`.

GitHub remains a projection of UbU state, not the source of truth. Phase 1 uses GitHub as a contributor-facing interface while keeping canonical Objective, Task, External Event, External Reference, Log, Plan, and projection state inside UbU.

Phase 1 may read any authorized GitHub object needed for import, planning, or reconciliation. Live GitHub writes are limited to explicitly managed projection surfaces:

- `ubu:`-prefixed labels or another explicitly configured UbU-owned label prefix;
- issue or PR body blocks delimited by UbU-managed HTML comments;
- UbU-authored comments that include stable projection identity and managed-marker text.

Milestones and assignees are preview-only by default in Phase 1. A live milestone or assignee write requires explicit human approval for that operation or a later accepted decision that narrows the automation rule.

PR statuses, CI checks, branch protection, repository settings, issue titles, and unmarked issue or PR body text are read/import-only in Phase 1. UbU does not set PR status checks or mutate arbitrary repository metadata as part of MVP projection.

All non-UbU GitHub edits are External Events. This includes edits outside UbU-managed surfaces and manual edits to UbU-managed labels, blocks, or comments. Such edits may create drift, mutation candidates, repair requests, Task candidates, or recalculation triggers, but they are not canonical state transitions by themselves.

A GitHub edit cannot directly override canonical UbU state. Canonical changes occur only through UbU's normal admission path, validation, authority checks, Compartment/export policy, and append-only Logs.

Missed updates are detected through manual sync, polling, webhook intake, fixture replay, or worker-submitted observations. The canonical UbU instance owns reconciliation admission. Automation Workers may poll GitHub, receive webhooks, compute candidate reconciliation reports, or submit projection requests when granted authority, but the canonical instance validates and logs accepted or rejected outcomes.

The reconciliation report compares at least:

- GitHub issues and PRs against External References that link them to UbU Objectives, Tasks, External Events, or Logs;
- managed labels against the expected projection of `pipeline_state` or other accepted projection metadata;
- managed blocks and comments against projection records and source UbU object refs;
- GitHub comments, reviews, PR changes, CI runs, and milestone changes against External Events and Logs;
- expected projection payloads against live GitHub state.

Report items should include external object identity, matched UbU object refs, External Reference refs, observed GitHub version or timestamp, expected projection version when any, drift classification, severity, provenance, and recommended handling.

MVP drift classes are `missing_external_reference`, `missing_external_event_log`, `stale_managed_projection`, `manual_edit_to_managed_surface`, `unexpected_ubu_label_or_block`, `foreign_edit_outside_ubu_surface`, `projection_request_failed`, and `github_object_missing_or_inaccessible`.

Drift produces a report before repair. It may recommend repair Tasks, mutation requests, projection update requests, External Reference verification, or recalculation. It must not silently create canonical repair Tasks or perform live GitHub writes in Phase 1; those require human approval or a later explicitly accepted policy.

Planner-relevant reconciliation findings create or batch `recalculation_triggered` Log entries with trigger kind `github_update`. Low-priority drift that does not affect the current Plan may mark projection or report caches stale instead of recalculating immediately.

**Consequences:**

- Phase 1 GitHub dogfooding can implement projection previews and live writes without deciding the full `pipeline_state` storage model in `UBU-Q0004`.
- `UBU-Q0005` can define GitHub event triage against the boundary that every GitHub edit is an External Event unless admitted through UbU.
- GitHub token custody is governed by `UBU-D0184`; this projection decision does not require the canonical instance to hold worker GitHub tokens.
- Workers retain request/report authority only; canonical state admission and human-approved live writes remain with the parent UbU instance.

## UBU-D0160: Model-committee run logs preserve reproducible provenance

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0036`.

The minimum `model-committee` run log for v0.1 and v0.2 is a filesystem run directory anchored by `manifest.json`. The manifest is the index of every input, schema, prompt, raw provider output, parsed provider output, candidate patch, validation result, score result, selected artifact, and review artifact produced by the run.

Required top-level artifacts are:

- `manifest.json`;
- `selected.patch` when selection succeeds or a human-review-required selected candidate exists;
- `commit_message.txt` when a commit message is produced;
- `review.md`;
- `inputs/`;
- `schemas/`;
- `prompts/`;
- `raw/`;
- `parsed/`;
- `patches/`;
- `scores/`.

The manifest required fields are `run_id`, `run_schema_version`, `tool_version`, `base_commit`, `working_tree_state`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `question_id`, selected question title and metadata, canonical input snapshot paths and hashes, schema artifact paths and hashes, provider configuration summary, provider invocation records, proposal records, patch validation records, score matrix path, disagreement flags, quorum result, selection result, selected proposal ID, selected patch path, review artifact paths, exit code, and artifact-publication status or instructions path. `working_tree_state` includes at least a clean/dirty flag and a path list for uncommitted changes visible to the run.

`inputs/` preserves snapshots of the canonical design files used by the run: `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`. If derived files or other repository files are used by a consistency check or work item, those inputs are also preserved as snapshots or hash-addressed references.

`schemas/` preserves the exact schemas or schema hashes used for work proposals, score results, the run manifest, provider invocation metadata, score-matrix entries, and review artifacts. A later schema migration may add fields, but a reviewer must be able to identify which schema version validated each artifact.

`prompts/`, `raw/`, and `parsed/` preserve provider provenance. Each provider invocation receives an `invocation_id`. Its record includes provider ID, provider class, model name or alias, phase, command/argv shape with secrets redacted, timeout, start and end timestamps, exit status, stdout path, stderr path, raw output path, parsed output path, schema path or hash, validation result, and failure class when applicable.

Provider-specific raw artifacts include Codex prompt files, Codex JSON outputs, Codex JSONL event logs, Codex stderr, Ollama prompts and raw responses, Claude Code prompts, raw Claude CLI JSON envelopes, and Claude schema-native `structured_output` payloads as extracted parsed artifacts. Provider failures are preserved with provider ID, model name when known, run phase, failure class, timeout or exit status, stderr or raw-response artifact path when available, and whether quorum remained satisfied.

`patches/` preserves one candidate patch per proposal, mechanical patch-validation results, selected patch identity, and selected patch validation diagnostics. `scores/` preserves score-matrix entries with author provider, scorer provider, proposal ID, score, validity, rationale, risks, and required fixes; retained self-scores are diagnostic and marked as non-quorum evidence.

Quorum and disagreement outcomes are first-class run artifacts. v0.2 logs preserve the score matrix, frontier cross-score provenance, disagreement flags, selected score, selected-score threshold result, selected patch validation result, quorum decision, human-review-required reason when applicable, and final exit code.

`review.md` must include the selected patch summary, relevant validation status, score matrix summary, disagreement and quorum status, human-review-required reason when applicable, and the operator-run commands for publishing the run directory to `../model-committee-artifacts`. Those commands are instructions only; `model-committee` must not execute artifact publication, remote push, PR creation, or canonical-file mutation automatically.

Run logs must not contain API keys, bearer tokens, credential files, private environment dumps, or unredacted secrets. They may record redacted argv shapes, credential reference kinds, provider IDs, configured model aliases, and artifact hashes needed for audit.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0036` is resolved for the v0.1/v0.2 minimum run-log and provenance format.
- `UBU-D0064` remains the v0.1 provisional-format starting point; this decision adds the accepted v0.2 minimum and makes the manifest explicit.
- The final long-term artifact format may evolve through schema migrations and later decisions, but the Phase 1 logging blocker is closed.
- `UBU-Q0046` can focus on which artifacts are published publicly and how they are summarized, not on what the local run log must preserve.
- Implementations may add artifacts or fields, but omitting the minimum artifacts requires a later accepted decision.

## UBU-D0161: Model-committee work proposals are validated patch artifacts

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.2

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0038`.

The `model-committee` work phase represents implementation as explicit patch artifacts, not hidden editor state or direct provider edits.

A work proposal is a schema-constrained envelope with at least: proposal ID, provider ID, model name, selected question or problem ID, base commit, summary, rationale, changed-file list, raw unified diff, suggested commit message, validation notes, declared new questions, declared resolved questions, declared decisions, and a human-review-required flag. The raw unified diff is the proposed state transition. Summaries, rationales, and commit messages help review, but they do not replace the patch.

Before work scoring, `model-committee` validates proposal JSON against the active schema, confirms the proposal targets the selected question or work item and expected base commit, checks changed files against the work item's allowlist, parses the unified diff, verifies that the patch applies to the recorded base snapshot, rejects forbidden paths or generated/private artifacts, verifies referenced question and decision IDs, and runs work-item-specific semantic checks when available. For v0.1 design work, the writable set is only `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`. Later code, schema, fixture, and bug-fix work uses the same proposal envelope but supplies a different allowlist, validators, tests, and expected review artifacts.

Mechanically invalid proposals are retained in run logs with diagnostics, but they are not eligible for automatic selection and do not count as valid work proposals for quorum. The scorer may be shown invalid-proposal diagnostics for critique, but selection must choose only from mechanically valid proposals.

Work scoring evaluates at least: correctness against the selected question or problem; consistency with accepted design decisions and authority boundaries; mechanical validity; minimality and focus; reviewability of the patch and commit message; risk, reversibility, and blast radius; validation or test adequacy; maintainability and generality beyond the immediate prompt; and whether new questions or decisions are warranted rather than silently expanding scope. Score records include score, validity judgment, rationale, risks, required fixes, and validation assumptions.

Models may score their own proposals only for diagnostic metadata. Self-scores do not count as quorum evidence and must be labeled non-quorum. In v0.1, Codex is the required scoring provider for valid Codex and Ollama work proposals, and Ollama proposals are included only after they pass the same schema and patch validation. In v0.2, Codex and Claude Code cross-score each other's frontier proposals; local/Ollama providers remain useful for diversity, dissent, fallback, and offline review but do not replace the required frontier cross-score unless a later decision changes quorum policy.

If a scorer selects a proposal that is later discovered to be mechanically invalid, automatic selection fails. The run must not silently apply or commit that patch. It writes review artifacts, validation diagnostics, and the invalid-selected-patch failure result. Choosing another proposal requires a valid score/selection record over the remaining mechanically valid proposals or a new run. v0.2 quorum, score-threshold, and disagreement failures use the human-review-required path rather than being treated as successful automatic selection.

`model-committee` v0.1 and v0.2 do not automatically apply patches to canonical files, create local commits, push artifacts, open pull requests, or mutate GitHub. A human operator may apply `selected.patch`, inspect `review.md`, run the relevant validation commands, and commit normally using `commit_message.txt` as a suggestion. Automatic local commit remains out of scope until a later accepted decision defines explicit approval, clean-worktree, validation, rollback, and authority rules.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0038` is resolved for the v0.1/v0.2 work-phase contract.
- `UBU-D0063`, `UBU-D0069`, `UBU-D0070`, `UBU-D0150`, and `UBU-D0160` remain compatible; this decision fills in the proposal, validation, scoring, invalid-selection, and commit-boundary details.
- The work phase generalizes from design-document patches to code changes and bug fixes through work-item-specific file allowlists, validators, tests, and review artifacts rather than through a different provider authority model.
- Any future automatic patch application or local commit feature requires a separate accepted decision.

## UBU-D0162: ContextBundles govern long-context exposure

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.3

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0083`.

A `ContextBundle` is the governed package of context assembled for a model, tool, worker, agent, or long-context review. It is not a transient prompt string or implementation detail. It is the auditable boundary between UbU's explicit state and an execution backend.

The minimum `ContextBundle` records `context_bundle_id`, `schema_version`, purpose, requested operation, actor Identity, related Task/Objective/workflow refs, route request and decision refs when used for LLM routing, destination provider/tool/worker/model refs, provider class and boundary classification, source refs, source selectors or ranges, source snapshot refs or hashes, Compartment refs, Compartment policy results, Identity refs exposed, Association refs exposed, Relationship refs exposed when applicable, data categories exposed, sensitivity summary, token or size estimate, redaction policy, minimization rules applied, excluded-source summary, prompt-injection exposure summary when untrusted external text is included, retention policy, training or secondary-use policy, user-visible summary, approval state, approval Log ref when applicable, creation and expiry times, invocation refs, downstream candidate refs, exposure summary ref, and Log refs.

Raw payload is allowed only when required by the task and allowed by policy. The preferred representation is references, selectors, summaries, hashes, redacted excerpts, and structural fields. Repository-scale, chat-archive-scale, or organizational-introspection bundles must record the selected paths, objects, time ranges, messages, or evidence selectors and also summarize excluded material. A broad archive name without selectors is not enough provenance for review.

Compartment policy is checked before context assembly and again before invocation. If any source is denied for the destination, UbU must either exclude that source and record the exclusion or deny the bundle. Mixed-Compartment bundles inherit the most restrictive applicable route. User approval, provider settings, workflow rules, and capability grants cannot override `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, `local_only`, or other hard Compartment denials.

User approval is required before routing a ContextBundle when protected payload, low-security un-compartmented content beyond structural references, Relationship evidence, Association evidence, private messages, broad repository or archive content, or other long-context bulk material leaves the local boundary, crosses to a cloud provider, external provider, remote worker, managed gateway, third-party tool, or crosses a materially different Identity or Association disclosure boundary. Approval is also required when provider, model, operator, region, retention/training profile, data category, minimization policy, source scope, or destination changes materially from an already approved workflow template.

Policy-based approval is allowed only for prior user-approved rules that name the workflow, destination class, allowed Compartments or data categories, maximum source scope, minimization rule, retention profile, cost limits when relevant, expiry, and review requirement. Such rules must fail closed on hard Compartment denials or materially broader context than the rule allowed. Local-only deterministic processing or local model use may proceed without per-run approval when local policy permits it and no new disclosure boundary is crossed.

After invocation, UbU records a context exposure summary as a review artifact. The summary includes actual provider/model/tool, invocation refs, source counts and categories, Compartments, Identities, Associations, and Relationships exposed, raw-versus-summary/reference volume, redactions and exclusions, retention/training profile, prompt-injection exposure notes, approval and routing Log refs, downstream candidate refs, and denied or omitted context that may affect output quality. Exposure summaries must not contain secrets or unnecessary raw payload.

ContextBundles are immutable after use. Corrections, narrower reruns, broader reruns, or provider changes create a new bundle or superseding revision linked by Logs. Candidate updates, AssociationAttestations, Log candidates, Plan repairs, Delegation Substrate packets, worker mutation requests, and other downstream outputs must carry originating ContextBundle refs or equivalent provenance. Approval, denial, invocation, output admission, and output rejection Logs link back to the relevant ContextBundle.

**Consequences:**

- Long-context model use can proceed only through explicit minimization, approval, routing, exposure-summary, and provenance records.
- Organizational introspection and repository/chat archive review can use large models without treating large context windows as permission to send everything.
- `UBU-Q0092` can refine typed Relationship evidence policies while relying on the ContextBundle boundary for model routing.
- `UBU-Q0100` can distinguish ContextBundle Compartment/export denials as hard structural boundaries rather than advisory safeguards.

## UBU-D0163: GitHub event triage is normalized, idempotent, and task-oriented

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27.5

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0005`.

GitHub event triage converts authorized GitHub observations into External Events, Logs, candidate Objectives, candidate Tasks, recalculation triggers, worker assignments, and projection requests. GitHub remains a projection and integration source, not canonical UbU state. A GitHub event therefore enters UbU through normalization, duplicate detection, External Reference matching, authority and Compartment checks, and append-only Logs before it affects planning.

Phase 1 has four log-only cases:

- duplicate webhook deliveries, fixture events, worker submissions, or reconciliation observations whose idempotency key already exists;
- reconciliation checks that verify no meaningful change to a GitHub object or managed projection surface;
- events outside the configured repository, object, milestone, or fixture import scope;
- projection write acknowledgements already represented by an accepted projection Log entry when the acknowledgement reveals no new GitHub state.

All other unique in-scope GitHub changes create a GitHub External Event and an `external_event_observed` Log entry, even if no Objective, Task, worker assignment, or projection update follows immediately. Source External References should link the GitHub object, delivery, timeline item, CI run, review, comment, or milestone record to the External Event and Log when the identifier is available.

Phase 1 triage rules for the candidate event classes are:

- `issue_opened`: create an External Event; create or link an issue-backed Objective when the issue represents durable work; create a triage or clarification Task when the issue lacks enough structure for planning.
- `issue_commented`: create an External Event; create a response, clarification, review, contributor-follow-up, or evidence-review Task only when the comment asks for action, supplies blocker or acceptance evidence, or changes a relationship-maintenance or project-follow-up need.
- `issue_labeled`: create an External Event; treat non-`ubu:` labels as evidence only; check UbU-managed labels for projection drift and recommend projection repair when they differ from accepted projection state.
- `issue_closed`: create an External Event; only transition linked Tasks or Objectives after admission validates that the modeled effect or Objective state is satisfied; otherwise create a reconciliation or clarification Task when closure conflicts with UbU state.
- `pr_opened`: create an External Event; link the PR to existing work when possible; usually create a PR-triage or review Task.
- `pr_updated`: create an External Event; create a re-review, CI-wait, or projection-update Task only when commits, body, title, base branch, mergeability, or linked issue state affects active work.
- `review_requested`: create an External Event and a review Task for the requested reviewer, user, or eligible worker path.
- `review_submitted`: create an External Event; approvals may unblock existing Tasks; change requests, blocking comments, or failed review requirements create follow-up Tasks.
- `ci_failed`: create an External Event plus a failure-analysis or fix Task; request Automation Worker assignment only when an admitted Task or Delegation Substrate packet has an eligible worker and explicit parent assignment path.
- `ci_passed`: create an External Event; usually unblock or complete waiting Tasks and may request projection update; create a new Task only when a next action such as merge review, release step, or projection repair is required.
- `milestone_changed`: create an External Event; create or update a release Objective, deadline fact, Calendar constraint, or release-planning Task when the change affects planned work.

GitHub events create Objectives only when they introduce durable desired state, release scope, or accepted project work that is not already represented by an Objective. Routine comments, labels, CI transitions, PR updates, and reviews attach as evidence to existing Objectives or Tasks rather than creating analysis Objectives by default.

GitHub events create Tasks when they imply concrete next action: triage, clarification, review, fix, projection repair, reconciliation, release planning, merge readiness, or contributor follow-up. Imported Tasks use normal Task admission, External References, provenance, Compartment/export checks, and duplicate detection.

Recalculation uses existing trigger kind `github_update`. Immediate recalculation is required when the event can affect the current or next recommended Task, hard feasibility, dependency or precondition truth, Task lifecycle state, Objective status, milestone or deadline constraints, worker assignment needed for current work, projection state that affects current work, or risk-report validity. Low-priority events may mark Calendar, projection, explanation, or report caches stale instead of recalculating immediately.

Automation Worker assignment is Task-driven, not GitHub-event-driven. A raw GitHub event may lead to a Task, Delegation Substrate packet, projection request, or reconciliation request; the parent UbU instance then explicitly assigns eligible worker work under the accepted worker-assignment model. Workers may observe, poll, or report GitHub events only under capability grants and do not create canonical state directly.

GitHub projection update requests are projection-driven. They arise when canonical UbU state changes or reconciliation detects drift in managed labels, managed body blocks, managed comments, milestone previews, or assignee previews. A GitHub event may recommend a projection preview or update request, but live writes still follow managed-surface and human-approval rules.

Duplicate detection uses two layers:

- Delivery-level deduplication uses the strongest normalized key available: GitHub delivery ID; otherwise repository identity, event class, action, external object type and ID, actor, source timestamp, object version such as commit SHA or CI run attempt, and affected UbU target.
- State-link deduplication uses the accepted External Reference uniqueness key plus Log `idempotency_key` checks so repeated observation updates verification metadata or records an idempotent no-op instead of duplicating External Events, Objectives, Tasks, projection requests, or reconciliation findings.

Missed events are reconstructed during reconciliation by comparing live GitHub issues, PRs, timelines, comments, reviews, CI runs, milestones, and managed projection surfaces against External References, imported External Events, Logs, and projection records. Reconstructed events receive GitHub-derived `effective_at` timestamps when available, reconciliation provenance, confidence metadata when needed, and synthetic idempotency keys. If only final state is available, UbU records the observed state transition or drift finding rather than inventing a precise unseen sequence.

**Consequences:**

- The candidate MVP event classes have deterministic default triage without requiring GitHub to become canonical state.
- `UBU-Q0004` is resolved by `UBU-D0182`; label and projection events can already be triaged as evidence or drift.
- GitHub token custody is governed by `UBU-D0184`; event triage does not require any specific actor to hold GitHub write credentials.
- GitHub event handling now aligns with append-only Logs, External References, worker assignment, recalculation triggers, and managed projection reconciliation.

## UBU-D0164: Worker mutation requests are candidate envelopes with versioned admission

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§17.5, 24.1.3

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0009`.

Phase 1 Automation Workers submit bounded candidate payloads, not direct canonical writes. The three supported payload families are event or observation submissions, mutation requests, and proposed patch artifacts. Event or observation submissions cover authorized External Event, Snapshot, Log-candidate, status, clarification, and recalculation requests. Mutation requests are the normal worker path for changing canonical UbU objects. Proposed patches are reviewable evidence or explicit patch-style mutation requests for supported textual or external artifacts; they are never direct edits to canonical state.

A worker mutation request is a state-transition envelope. The minimum fields are `mutation_request_id`, `schema_version`, `parent_instance_ref`, `worker_identity_ref`, `capability_grant_ref`, `authority_source`, `submitted_at`, `target_ref`, `operation`, `operation_payload` or `new_value`, `reason`, `evidence_refs`, `provenance`, `idempotency_key`, and either `expected_prior_version` or an explicit no-prior-version reason for create-only requests. Optional fields include `assignment_ref`, `effective_at`, `old_value_observed`, `originating_context_bundle_refs`, `compartment_refs`, `compartment_policy_result`, `confidence`, `review_requirement`, `batch_id`, `batch_atomicity`, and `supersedes_request_ref`.

Phase 1 mutation operations are a closed typed set: UniverseState mutation-list requests; Task lifecycle transition requests, including completion, failure, moot, and estimate or delegation-field updates; Objective transition requests; External Reference create, verify, supersede, or duplicate-link requests; `pipeline_state` projection-state requests; Task or Objective candidate creation requests; Task-to-Container restructuring requests; and Log correction or annotation requests. New operation kinds require a schema migration or accepted decision. Projection writes, GitHub API actions, and external side effects remain separate projection or AgentAction requests.

A valid request is applied immediately only when schema validation, semantic validation, capability scope, Compartment/export policy, idempotency, expected-prior-version checks, assignment lease status, and operation review policy all pass and the request's `review_requirement` allows automatic application. Otherwise a valid request remains a submitted candidate awaiting human or policy review. Invalid, unauthorized, stale, duplicate-conflicting, or policy-denied requests are logged as `worker_mutation_rejected` with a sanitized reason and evidence references when safe. Every received mutation request creates a `worker_mutation_submitted` Log entry or operation-specific submission record; applied requests create `worker_mutation_applied` entries.

Batches are allowed when the request envelope declares a `batch_id` and `batch_atomicity`. `all_or_nothing` batches validate the whole batch before application and either apply every item in declared order or reject the batch without partial canonical mutation. `independent_items` batches may apply valid items and reject invalid items separately, but this is not atomic. MVP implementations may restrict atomic batches to one parent instance and one validation transaction.

Workers may request creation of new Objectives, Tasks, External References, child Tasks, or Containers only as mutation requests or candidates. They do not receive direct create authority in Phase 1. Objective creation should require review by default unless a later accepted policy grants a very narrow auto-create path. Task creation may be auto-applied only when the grant, assignment, operation kind, target scope, and review policy explicitly allow it.

Worker mutations are reversible only through append-only repair. UbU does not rewrite or delete the original request or applied Log entry. Reversal uses a compensating mutation, Log correction, superseding object, Task moot transition, or projection repair. Requests should include enough observed old value, evidence, and expected-prior-version metadata to make compensation possible when the operation is logically reversible. Irreversible external side effects require projection or AgentAction mitigation metadata rather than ordinary mutation reversal.

Stale overwrite prevention is mandatory. The canonical instance compares `expected_prior_version` or equivalent target version metadata with current canonical state before applying mutation requests. A mismatch rejects the request or converts it into a conflict candidate for review; it must not silently overwrite newer state. Idempotency keys prevent duplicate application, assignment leases prevent expired worker work from being accepted accidentally, and capability-grant versions prevent revoked or changed authority from authorizing late submissions.

**Consequences:**

- Worker authority remains request-based and bounded by capability grants, Compartment policy, expected versions, idempotency, assignment leases, and review policy.
- Valid worker outputs can support automation without granting direct canonical write authority.
- Invalid and stale worker submissions remain auditable without polluting canonical state.
- `UBU-Q0084` remains open for external AgentAction side-effect modeling.

## UBU-D0165: Safeguards distinguish hard boundaries from advisory behavioral risk

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§2.10.2, 22.4

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0100`.

UbU classifies safeguards into four governance categories.

**Product hard boundaries** are structural invariants UbU can enforce through the data model, routing layer, authorization checks, validation, storage layout, provenance, or append-only audit mechanics. The accepted hard-boundary set includes Compartment denials, privacy/export policy, data-access authorization, EvidenceUsePolicy restrictions, identity and Compartment isolation, integration authorization, provenance integrity, audit-record integrity, and immutable Log/correction rules. A user preference, workflow setting, provider preference, or ordinary approval click cannot override these denials.

**External hard constraints** are provider, platform, app-store, integration, or legal constraints that UbU must obey for a specific jurisdiction, distribution channel, account, or external surface. They are source-labeled constraints rather than independent expressions of UbU philosophy. When practical, UbU should record their source, scope, affected integration or workflow, enforcement mechanism, review path, and last verification time. If the constraint is explicit and mechanically detectable, UbU may refuse the action. If the constraint depends on uncertain interpretation, UbU should disclose uncertainty and avoid claiming full legal or platform-policy enforcement.

**User-configured required gates** are self-imposed user, Identity, Association, or project policy gates. They may block a workflow while enabled, but they are not product invariants and must not be documented as proof that the underlying behavioral judgment is mechanically certain. A required gate should record the configuring authority, scope, trigger, required review, bypass or disablement authority, expiration or review cadence when any, and Log refs for configuration, bypass, disablement, or denial.

**Advisory behavioral safeguards** are fallible risk assessments. Examples include manipulation, coercion, harassment, stalking, deception, romantic or professional power-asymmetry risk, vulnerability exploitation, rumination risk, relationship-transition ethics, and similar behavioral misuse checks. These depend on classifiers, heuristics, evidence quality, cultural context, and user interpretation. They should generally be default-on, uncertainty-aware, transparent about false-positive and false-negative risk, user-overrideable, and introspection-relevant when bypassed.

Behavioral-risk checks should not be unconditional hard gates by default. Treating them as hard gates would risk blocking legitimate autonomous action, over-trusting false negatives, and falsely advertising that UbU can reliably prevent misuse, illegal behavior, or harm. UbU may still refuse a workflow when the requested action violates a product hard boundary, an external hard constraint, or a currently enabled user-configured required gate.

Documentation and UI copy must distinguish these categories. Strong claims such as enforce, prevent, disallow, cannot, or must not should be used only for named hard boundaries with an actual enforcement path. Behavioral-safeguard copy should use advisory language such as recommends, warns, asks for review, flags uncertainty, records bypass, or blocks only because the user configured this gate. Public documentation must not imply that UbU polices all harmful, illegal, coercive, stalking, harassing, deceptive, or manipulative behavior.

This decision does not remove future safety work. It fixes the authority boundary: structural enforcement protects product integrity and privacy, external constraints are obeyed as external constraints, user-required gates express chosen self-governance, and behavioral-risk safeguards remain advisory unless another accepted hard boundary applies.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0101` remains open for the detailed UX of uncertainty display, bypass controls, disablement, and introspection consequences.
- Relationship and RelationshipScopeTransition safeguards use the same taxonomy as the rest of UbU rather than a separate paternalistic gate model.
- Product and public documentation must avoid claiming that UbU reliably prevents behavioral misuse or illegal behavior.
- Implementation schemas may add a safeguard-category enum or policy-gate records later, but the Phase 1 design boundary is now settled.

## UBU-D0166: GPU planning kernel stochastic model

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.10; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §§3, 7

Task durations use a shifted log-normal distribution for stochastic duration estimates, and fixed-duration Tasks use an explicit delta model. The three-point stochastic duration estimate is now specified as `(min_seconds, mode_seconds, p95_seconds)`, where `min_seconds` is the optimistic lower support shift, `mode_seconds` is the most likely duration, and `p95_seconds` is the 95th percentile rather than a hard cap. The canonical conversion to log-normal `mu` and `sigma` is specified in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` and resolved by `UBU-D0174`.

Correlation groups use named positive latent factors with explicit strength. Each Task may carry `correlation_groups: [{group: str, strength: float}]`, with strength in `[0, 1]`. Joint sampling in the Monte Carlo rollout stage uses Gaussian copula sampling over the deterministic latent-factor correlation matrix specified in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` and resolved by `UBU-D0172`.

Latent factor loadings beyond the Phase 1 positive correlation-group model, negative correlations, learned correlation structures, and richer stochastic models remain post-MVP.

**Consequences:**

- The log-normal parameterization directly motivates and formalizes the forward-pull early-completion behavior described in `DESIGN.md §16.6`.
- `UBU-Q0104` and `UBU-Q0106` are resolved for Phase 1 by the deterministic positive-factor matrix construction and `p95` duration semantics.
- Future implementations may add richer stochastic models only if they preserve replayability, schema versioning, and CPU validation.

## UBU-D0167: GPU planning kernel affect constraint architecture

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§13.7, 16.10; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §6

Affect constraints in the GPU planning kernel use sigmoid-family functional form. Piecewise-linear form is rejected for this use.

Sigmoid is mandated over piecewise-linear because:

- UbU intends to eventually infer AffectProfile parameters from execution history; sigmoid parameters are directly fittable with standard logistic regression or MLE whereas piecewise-linear fitting is a non-standard constrained optimization;
- sigmoid naturally models gradual saturation at extremes, preventing the hard-clipping planning artifacts that piecewise-linear produces near constraint boundaries;
- recovery curves typically follow an S-shape that sigmoid captures with two parameters and piecewise-linear approximates poorly with fewer than four hand-placed breakpoints.

The three MVP affect dimensions — energy, stress, and mood intensity — each carry an independent sigmoid satisfaction function. The output is a constraint-satisfaction score in `[0, 1]`, not a literal success probability and not canonical utility. `energy` is `higher_is_better`; `stress` is `lower_is_better`; `mood_intensity` is `lower_is_better` and means affective arousal or volatility intensity rather than mood valence.

Phase 1 must not require ordinary users to hand-edit raw sigmoid parameters. The UI should use qualitative calibration questions and map them into the internal schema. Conservative bootstrap defaults are permitted as temporary planning priors and must be marked for review. Advanced users may inspect and edit raw parameters.

The GPU pipeline stage that applies sigmoid affect constraints is named `affect_legitimacy_filter`. Full legitimization in UbU design refers to the broader process of making a skeleton Plan human-viable by adding or respecting affect, recovery, transition, rest, sustainability, and support constraints. The `affect_legitimacy_filter` GPU stage implements only the sigmoid affect-constraint portion of that broader process; it does not replace or subsume full legitimization.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0105` is resolved for Phase 1 by the per-dimension schema and bootstrap UX semantics in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`.
- Manual raw sigmoid editing is an advanced capability, not a normal Phase 1 onboarding requirement.
- Composite or cross-dimension affect interactions remain post-MVP.

## UBU-D0168: GPU engine internal architecture

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.10; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §5

The GPU planning engine is a pure function. Its inputs are carried by `PlanningRequest`; its output is a `PlanningResponse` containing ranked PlanCandidates, diagnostics, warnings, and probability-quality metadata. The engine has no side effects, no mutable state, and performs no I/O. The CPU kernel owns all state mutation; the GPU engine is advisory only.

The engine is invoked as a typed Python function call, not a subprocess or service. The framework is PyTorch.

All tensor batches use padded fixed-size shape `(N_CANDIDATES, MAX_PLANNING_TASKS, ...)` with an explicit boolean validity mask tensor marking valid task slots. Ragged tensors are not used in Phase 1.

`MAX_PLANNING_TASKS = 256` is the Phase 1 planning window ceiling. This constant is defined at a single site. Future premium or wide-horizon tiers may increase this ceiling by scalar configuration, subject to memory, scenario-count, correlation-matrix, validation-cost, and backend performance limits. Linear scaling is not assumed as a mathematical guarantee.

The four pipeline stages are first-class design artifacts:

1. **Skeleton sampling** — parallel shifted-log-normal or fixed duration sampling across candidates with vectorized topological-order constraint propagation;
2. **`affect_legitimacy_filter`** — batch sigmoid affect constraint evaluation; eliminates candidates that fail feasibility thresholds;
3. **Value scoring** — parallel utility, approximate robustness, affect-margin, and schedule-diversity scoring across surviving candidates;
4. **Monte Carlo rollout** — joint scenario simulation using correlation-group Gaussian copula for finalists.

The Phase 1 performance target is a local desktop/laptop GPU backend. A CPU reference path or fixture-backed deterministic path remains required for tests, CI, and contributors without GPU hardware. Mobile and cloud planner backends are deferred beyond Phase 1.

GPU search proposes candidates. Hard constraint certification and final Plan validity are performed by the CPU kernel using exact or conservative validation, not by the GPU engine.

**Consequences:**

- Pure function architecture means the GPU engine can be tested by input/output comparison in isolation from other UbU state.
- The CPU reference path is a Phase 1 requirement, not optional.
- `UBU-Q0103` is resolved for Phase 1 by the stage-boundary semantics in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`; exact tensor dtypes and implementation classes belong in `model-committee`.

## UBU-D0169: CPU/GPU interface contract

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.10; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §§1-4

The CPU/GPU boundary is defined by two typed objects — `PlanningRequest` and `PlanningResponse`. The dedicated minimal schema document for these objects is `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`.

`PlanningRequest` carries schema and planner versioning, request identity, effective time, generation time, mode (`fresh_generation` or `repair`), RNG seed, time-window policy, horizon policy, compute budget, task graph, UniverseState snapshot, AffectProfile, scoring policy, constraint policy, and privacy/provenance payload-safety proof. Optional fields include external event assumptions, repair context, explanation request, and debug flags.

`PlanningResponse` returns ranked PlanCandidates plus diagnostics, warnings, probability-quality metadata, rejection counts, coverage estimate when available, and compute telemetry when available. `K=3` PlanCandidates remains the Phase 1 default: highest-utility, most-robust, and most-schedule-diverse.

The Phase 1 performance target is a local desktop/laptop GPU backend. A CPU reference path or fixture-backed deterministic path remains required for tests, CI, and contributors without GPU hardware. Mobile and cloud planner backends are deferred beyond Phase 1.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0102` is resolved for Phase 1 by `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`.
- The interface contract is backend-agnostic and can be reused by deferred mobile and cloud backends when implemented.
- GPU or CPU-reference planner output remains advisory until CPU validation certifies a candidate Plan.

## UBU-D0170: PlanningRequest and PlanningResponse Phase 1 schema

**Status:** Accepted → PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §§1-4

`PlanningRequest` and `PlanningResponse` are now specified as the Phase 1 planning-kernel boundary. The contract includes explicit schema versioning, planner versioning, request IDs, effective time, generation time, reproducible RNG seed, time-window policy, one-minute full-detail planning delta default, one-hour reactive horizon default, `0.99` short-horizon branch coverage target default, compute budget, task graph with CPU-provided `topological_order`, UniverseState snapshot, AffectProfile, scoring policy, constraint policy, payload policy summary, payload-safety proof, optional external event assumptions, optional repair context, optional explanation request, and optional debug flags.

`PlanningResponse` must return ranked PlanCandidates plus diagnostics rather than only a schedule. Diagnostics include candidate counts by stage, rejection counts by reason, warnings, probability-quality classification, optional coverage estimate, optional compute telemetry such as `duration_ms`, and stage funnel counts such as `n_skeleton_candidates`, `n_after_affect_filter`, `n_after_value_scoring`, and `n_finalists_rollout`.

`effective_time` is the logical planning time and may differ from `generated_at` for replay, fixture testing, or repair from a recorded Log point. `affect_constraint_mode: warn_only` is an explicit operational mode for test fixtures, onboarding, debugging, or missing AffectProfile situations; it is not silent threshold relaxation. User-facing contexts default to `enforce`.

**Consequences:**

- Implementation work can begin against this schema without waiting for mobile, cloud, realtime, or multi-user payload fields.
- Future schema changes must preserve replayability through explicit versioning.
- Privacy compliance remains represented by both a compact policy summary and a CPU-generated payload-safety proof, not by a single human-readable flag.

## UBU-D0171: GPU pipeline stage-boundary contract

**Status:** Accepted → PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §5

The four GPU pipeline stages have Phase 1 semantic input/output boundaries: `skeleton_sampling`, `affect_legitimacy_filter`, `value_scoring`, and `monte_carlo_rollout`.

The design contract specifies the semantic data each stage consumes and produces. Exact tensor dtypes, device placement, batching mechanics, PyTorch module layout, and implementation classes belong in `model-committee`. This prevents `ubu-design` from becoming an implementation-code repository while still giving implementation generators enough structure to proceed.

Stage 1 consumes a CPU-provided `topological_order`; the GPU engine does not discover graph order. Stage 4 uses deterministic rollout seed derivation from the request seed. The Phase 1 default rollout budget is `n_rollouts = 1000` per finalist unless overridden by the CPU kernel's compute budget.

`PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` includes a Phase 1 recommended tensor profile using implementation-facing names such as `start_time_offsets`, `validity_mask`, `feasible_mask`, `surviving_indices`, `feasibility_scores`, `composite_scores`, `top_k_indices`, and probability intervals. These names guide implementation and tests without turning `ubu-design` into the PyTorch source tree.

**Consequences:**

- The stage names, semantic boundaries, CPU-provided topological order requirement, and deterministic seed-stream convention are canonical.
- Implementation details may vary as long as they preserve the contract and replayable output semantics.

## UBU-D0172: Correlation-group matrix construction and PSD handling

**Status:** Accepted → PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §7

Phase 1 correlation groups use positive latent-factor loading construction. `strength` is constrained to `[0, 1]`. Negative correlations, signed loadings, learned correlations, and richer latent-factor models are deferred beyond Phase 1.

This is not a philosophical rejection of negative correlations. Anti-correlations are mathematically valid and planning-relevant, but arbitrary signed pairwise-correlation declarations are likely to produce non-PSD matrices and confusing user-facing validation failures. Phase 1 therefore uses a deterministic PSD-by-construction model and records signed/negative correlation support as Phase 2 work, likely through signed latent factors, explicit Cholesky-style parameterization, or a signed partial-correlation model.

Each Task's group-strength vector is normalized when its squared norm exceeds `0.95^2`, preserving relative declared strengths while reserving residual idiosyncratic variance. The matrix is constructed as `C = L * L^T + diag(1 - row_norm(L)^2)`. This yields a symmetric unit-diagonal positive semi-definite matrix by construction up to floating-point error. Multiple shared groups combine through the dot product of normalized loading vectors.

CPU validation checks finite values, duplicate group declarations, range constraints, symmetry, unit diagonal, and factorization. Numeric jitter may be applied for floating-point error with explicit degraded diagnostics. Silent nearest-PSD projection is not a Phase 1 semantic repair. If factorization still fails after jitter, the CPU kernel either rejects the request or runs an explicitly degraded independent rollout with `probability_quality = degraded_independence`, depending on caller strictness and visible diagnostics.

**Consequences:**

- The MVP planner supports positive shared-delay correlation while avoiding arbitrary matrix repair.
- Degraded independent rollout is allowed only as an explicit diagnostic fallback, not as silent certainty.
- Negative-correlation support remains a recorded roadmap item rather than an indefinite deferral.

## UBU-D0173: Sigmoid affect constraint semantics and bootstrap UX

**Status:** Accepted → PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §6

Sigmoid affect outputs are constraint-satisfaction scores in `[0, 1]`. They are not literal success probabilities, not durable user preferences, and not canonical utility. Each active affect dimension has `dimension`, `direction`, `location`, `scale`, `threshold`, and optional freshness metadata.

Phase 1 directions are: energy is `higher_is_better`; stress is `lower_is_better`; mood intensity is `lower_is_better` and means affective arousal/volatility intensity, not mood valence. Positive excitement and negative agitation can both consume planning capacity, so Phase 1 treats high intensity as constraining.

This `mood_intensity` choice is a deliberate Phase 1 simplification. The longer-term design treats arousal/activation as task-dependent: routine tasks may favor low arousal, while creative, social, or physical tasks may require a higher optimal range. Phase 2 should add a `bounded_optimum` direction with `optimal_low` and `optimal_high` fields plus task/category affect overrides.

Candidate affect feasibility requires satisfaction greater than or equal to the active threshold for each active dimension at the CPU-selected evaluation point or points. Missing or stale affect observations must be surfaced through warning, quick check-in, bootstrap defaults, or `warn_only` mode; stale assumptions must not be silently presented as current measured state.

Phase 1 UX must not require ordinary users to edit raw sigmoid parameters. The UI should ask qualitative calibration questions and map answers into sigmoid parameters. Conservative bootstrap defaults are allowed and marked for review: energy `location = 4.0`, `scale = 1.5`, `threshold = 0.5`; stress `location = 7.0`, `scale = 1.5`, `threshold = 0.5`; mood intensity `location = 8.0`, `scale = 1.5`, `threshold = 0.5`. Advanced users may inspect and edit raw sigmoid parameters.

**Consequences:**

- Raw sigmoid configuration is no longer a normal-user prerequisite for Phase 1 onboarding.
- The planning kernel can implement `affect_legitimacy_filter` without resolving richer affect inference or cross-dimension models.
- The bounded-optimum arousal model with task/category overrides is explicitly roadmapped for Phase 2, not abandoned.

## UBU-D0174: Shifted log-normal duration semantics and invalid triple handling

**Status:** Accepted → PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §3

Phase 1 stochastic Task durations use `shifted_lognormal_p95` with fields `min_seconds`, `mode_seconds`, and `p95_seconds`. All duration fields use seconds for consistency with `planning_delta_seconds` and all other planning-kernel time fields.

- `min_seconds` is the optimistic lower support shift. It is used as the mathematical lower support for sampling. It is not a claim that real-world durations physically cannot be shorter; it is a modeling prior representing the user's subjective best-case estimate.
- `mode_seconds` is the most likely duration.
- `p95_seconds` is the 95th percentile and not a hard upper cap. The planner may sample durations greater than `p95_seconds`.

The shifted distribution is `D = min_seconds + LogNormal(mu, sigma)`. The canonical conversion is:

```text
a   = mode_seconds - min_seconds
b   = p95_seconds  - min_seconds
z95 = 1.6448536269514722

sigma = (-z95 + sqrt(z95^2 + 4 * ln(b / a))) / 2
mu    = ln(a) + sigma^2
```

Invalid stochastic triples (`min_seconds >= mode_seconds` or `mode_seconds >= p95_seconds`) are rejected at schema validation time. The schema must not silently repair invalid triples. A UI may offer to convert `min = mode = p95` to a fixed-duration model. Fixed known durations use `{type: "fixed", seconds: N}` as a delta distribution; they must not be represented as a very tight log-normal.

Validation occurs twice: structurally at `TaskSpec` construction and again when the CPU builds `PlanningRequest` tensors. Errors should identify the Task ID and violated ordering or unit constraint.

The explicit `p95_seconds` field name replaces the ambiguous `max` field name used in prior design drafts.

**Consequences:**

- Duration semantics are deterministic and replayable.
- `p95_seconds` naming removes prior ambiguity about whether `max` was P90, P95, P99, or a hard cap.
- Seconds-unit consistency eliminates unit-conversion bugs at stage boundaries.

## UBU-D0175: Phase 1 design automation stop rule

**Status:** Accepted

Broad pre-MVP design automation stops after resolution of the Phase 1 planning-kernel blockers `UBU-Q0102` through `UBU-Q0106`.

Future design work may block Phase 1 only when it is required to implement the single-user GitHub dogfooding loop, enforce an accepted hard invariant, specify a contract needed by currently planned code, or avoid a known irreversible schema contradiction.

All other open questions must be deferred, converted into implementation tickets, answered as post-MVP design work, or represented by conservative defaults, TODOs, feature flags, or versioned placeholder fields.

`model-committee` may still analyze design questions and propose patches, but it must no longer create new MVP blockers unless the blocker is discovered during implementation of a concrete Phase 1 slice and includes a blocker certificate:

- the exact implementation object, file, or acceptance test blocked;
- the failed acceptance criterion;
- why a conservative default, TODO, feature flag, or placeholder is unsafe;
- the minimum answer needed to unblock implementation;
- whether the answer is expected to mutate persistent schema or only local code behavior.

A new MVP blocker should normally replace or narrow an existing blocker, not expand Phase 1 scope. If a proposed blocker is philosophical, outreach-oriented, Phase 2/3-oriented, or merely improves completeness, it must not block Phase 1.

Implementation should now proceed slice-by-slice. A slice may begin when no unresolved question blocks that slice. Phase 1 readiness is therefore evaluated by implementation-slice readiness, not by global philosophical completion of the design model.

**Consequences:**

- Broad design expansion no longer blocks Phase 1 implementation.
- Implementation-local design clarification remains allowed when backed by a blocker certificate.
- `model-committee` transitions from pre-MVP design-freeze assistance toward implementation-support dogfooding.
- Future open questions may remain in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` without preventing Phase 1 implementation unless they meet the D0175 blocker standard.

## UBU-D0176: PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md is a canonical source file for model-committee runs

**Status:** Accepted

Supersedes the file list in UBU-D0056.

The canonical source files for model-committee question-answering and work-proposal generation are:

- `DESIGN.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`
- `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`

`PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` is a Phase 1 design artifact referenced by UBU-D0169 through UBU-D0174. It defines the CPU/GPU planning-kernel boundary contract including `PlanningRequest`, `PlanningResponse`, `TaskSpec` duration semantics, GPU pipeline stage boundaries, sigmoid affect constraint schema, and correlation matrix construction. Model-committee runs must read it as context and may propose patches to it subject to the same patch-validation rules as the other canonical source files.

---

## UBU-D0177: Phase 1 MCP tools are capability-scoped candidate surfaces

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.4

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0079`.

UbU may act as both MCP-style client and server in Phase 1, but the server-side tool surface is limited to query and candidate-submission operations. The Phase 1 exposed tool set is:

- `plan_summary.read`;
- `objective_status.query`;
- `task_candidate.create`;
- `log_candidate.submit`;
- `plan_repair.submit`;
- `clarification.request`;
- `delegation_packet.prepare`;
- `projection_preview.submit`;
- `association_attestation_candidate.submit` for fixtures or manually reviewed Association-introspection dogfooding.

These tools do not directly mutate canonical Objectives, Tasks, Logs, UniverseState, External References, Plans, Calendars, projection state, credentials, or external systems. Write-like calls produce candidate envelopes, worker-style mutation requests, projection requests, clarification requests, or review artifacts. The canonical UbU instance validates schema, semantics, authority, Compartment policy, idempotency, expected prior version, workflow or assignment status, and review policy before applying, rejecting, or leaving a candidate pending.

A minimum MCP capability grant records grant ID, issuing parent instance, actor Identity, integration or agent identity, allowed tool names, operation kinds, payload schema refs, object scope, Objective subtree scope, Task set or Container scope, Compartment constraints, Identity or Association disclosure constraints when applicable, integration or destination refs, time window or expiration, rate and cost limits, review requirement, idempotency/version requirement, audit policy, lifecycle status, and revocation refs. Compartment policy is a hard upper bound; a grant cannot override `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, `no_external_export`, allowed-integration, allowed-device, identity-isolation, or EvidenceUsePolicy denials.

Every tool call that reaches UbU creates an append-only audit record with redacted argument summary or hash, policy decision, source and destination Identity, Compartment result, cost and rate counters when relevant, result refs, denial or failure reason when safe, and downstream candidate refs. Denied calls fail closed. Retries require the same idempotency key or an explicit superseding request. Rollback uses append-only repair through compensating mutation, Log correction, supersession, Task moot transition, projection repair, or AgentAction mitigation metadata; prior invocation and candidate records are not rewritten.

The minimum dogfooding fixture is a local loopback MCP adapter over synthetic or redacted UbU project data. It exposes the Phase 1 tools, exercises capability grants and Compartment denials, writes only candidate/review artifacts and audit Logs, and supports a dry-run client path for calling external tools without live external mutation.

**Consequences:**

- Phase 1 external agents can integrate with UbU without broad authority over the user's life model.
- MCP tool access reuses the worker mutation, ContextBundle, Compartment, Log, and review boundaries rather than creating a parallel authorization model.
- Direct canonical writes, credential mutation, and live external side effects remain outside MCP server authority unless a later accepted decision adds a narrower tool with explicit hard-boundary checks.
- `UBU-Q0080` can define Delegation Substrate fields on top of this candidate and capability boundary.

## UBU-D0178: Model-committee consistency gates prioritization and ordinary work

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.3

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0039`.

`model-committee` enforces the loop accepted in `UBU-D0066` with three priority levels:

1. system-wide consistency;
2. question/problem prioritization;
3. ordinary work.

Each run records loop state: base commit, canonical input hashes, consistency status, blocking failure IDs, warning IDs, selected loop mode, selected work item, provider/version baseline, and whether derived scores were reused or invalidated.

System-wide consistency checks run before prioritization and ordinary work. They are triggered by:

- new base commit, merge, rebase, checkout, or human-applied patch affecting canonical files;
- directive decision or other direct edit to `DECISIONS.md`;
- edits to `DESIGN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, or `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`;
- prompt, schema, validator, quorum, provider-weight, provider-config, or tool-version changes;
- enabled LLM model, model-alias, or provider capability changes;
- Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI, Ollama, or other approved provider CLI version or behavior changes;
- explicit operator request, scheduled audit, doctor run, or prior run ending with consistency, quorum, or validation failure;
- derived-document changes when derived-document checks are enabled.

Hard consistency failures block ordinary prioritization and ordinary work. Hard failures include:

- missing or unparseable canonical files;
- duplicate question or decision IDs;
- malformed question metadata;
- dependency references to missing questions;
- dependency cycles;
- invalid `Resolved by` references;
- solved, decomposed, deferred, or superseded status contradictions;
- selected-work dependency violations;
- patch-base mismatch or canonical input changes after the consistency snapshot;
- forbidden-path proposals.

Warnings do not block prioritization when they cannot invalidate the selected work item. Warnings include stale derived documents, unscored or `TBD` ranking fields, optional provider failures when quorum remains satisfiable, nonblocking provider version drift, stale historical scores, and derived artifact publication gaps. A run that continues with warnings must record them and exclude stale scores from automatic selection.

Hard failures are converted into consistency problem records with stable failure key, severity, affected files or object IDs, evidence, suggested repair, and whether a human decision is required. If the repair is mechanical and within the allowed file set, model-committee may solicit repair patches. If the repair exposes an unresolved design choice, it may create or update an open question. New MVP blockers must satisfy the `UBU-D0175` blocker-certificate rule.

Ordinary work may proceed against a known inconsistency only when the selected work item repairs or narrows that inconsistency, declares the relevant failure IDs, avoids relying on invalid derived ranking, and reruns consistency after the candidate patch. It must not mix unrelated design answering with consistency repair unless both are necessary for the same failure.

LLM model updates and provider CLI updates do not retroactively change committed canonical design state or historical run logs. They do invalidate reusable derived rankings, readiness estimates, and score evidence that depend on the old provider baseline. Before automatic selection reuses such artifacts, model-committee must rerun consistency and, when the selected proposal depends on old scores, rescore or require human review.

Future integrated UbU Automation Worker behavior should map this loop to ordinary worker semantics: consistency checks are high-priority assigned work; repair outputs are mutation or patch candidates; canonical state changes only after parent validation and human repository review where required.

**Consequences:**

- Consistency repair is the only work mode allowed while hard failures are present.
- Prioritization may run with warnings only when warning provenance is recorded and stale score evidence is excluded.
- Provider and model updates invalidate reusable derived scores without rewriting accepted canonical state or historical run logs.

## UBU-D0179: Public dogfooding artifacts publish sanitized review packages

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.1.3

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0046`.

`model-committee` public dogfooding should publish sanitized review packages, not complete private run logs by default. The public package must show enough evidence for a contributor to verify the loop: selected question or problem, base commit, canonical input hashes, provider proposals, mechanical validation, score matrix or scoring summary, quorum or disagreement outcome, selected patch, suggested commit message, human-review status, and eventual canonical commit, Issue, or PR link when available.

Default public artifacts:

- `review.md`;
- `selected.patch` when a selected or reviewable candidate exists;
- `commit_message.txt` when available;
- `manifest.public.json` or an equivalent redacted manifest;
- score-matrix and validation summaries;
- links to the source question, related Issue or PR, accepted decision, and final commit when available.

Not public by default:

- raw provider logs, prompts, stderr, JSONL traces, and full manifests;
- private chain-of-thought or hidden reasoning;
- unsafe or policy-violating provider outputs;
- API keys, bearer tokens, credential paths, private environment dumps, or secrets;
- unredacted sensitive context or Compartment-protected payloads.

Raw artifacts may be published only after explicit redaction and artifact-safety review. Hashes and summarized diagnostics should be preferred when the raw material is not needed for public review.

Failed and partially successful runs are publishable when labeled by failure class and next review action. Acceptable public failure classes include parse failure, schema failure, invalid patch, no valid proposal, no quorum, selected score below threshold, critical disagreement, provider timeout, and artifact-safety block. A failed run should demonstrate bounded authority and preserved evidence; it must not imply accepted design state.

`model-committee` may generate publication commands and GitHub/PR link placeholders, but it must not auto-publish artifacts, open PRs, push branches, mutate GitHub, apply patches, or mark canonical questions solved. Human review remains required to publish artifacts, accept patches, and connect a run to a final repository commit.

**Consequences:**

- Public credibility comes from reviewable run packages and accepted commits, not from dumping every raw provider artifact.
- `UBU-Q0063` may depend on this policy for organizational-introspection dogfooding artifacts.
- Future implementation should add an artifact-safety check and a redacted public manifest schema before publishing run packages.

## UBU-D0180: Release Outreach Pipeline uses structured packages and gated publication

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§2.6, 4.1.3

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0049`.

A release outreach package is a derived release artifact set, not a new Phase 1 canonical entity. It is attached to ordinary Objectives, WorkItems, Logs, release artifacts, External References, Automation Worker outputs, and export/projection gates.

Minimum package artifacts:

- `manifest.json`: package ID, schema version, project/release refs, version or release range, base commit or build refs, generated/updated timestamps, actor Identity, package status, linked Objective/Task/Log refs, source summary, Compartment/export summary, and package hash list.
- `claim_register.json`: claim ID, text, audience, claim kind, support status, evidence refs, source object refs, allowed public wording, review state, and publication eligibility.
- `evidence_index.json`: release notes, accepted decisions, closed issues, commits, tests, fixtures, screenshots, recordings, risk reports, or other evidence with hashes, selectors, source refs, and capture/import provenance.
- Draft artifacts: public release notes, developer release notes, video script, narration text, captions, YouTube title/description/chapters, announcement drafts, known limitations, future-work notes, and contributor calls-to-action when relevant.
- `media_refs.json`: screenshot, UI-test export, fixture capture, and demo-recording references. Raw media is copied into the package only when export policy allows it and review approves it.
- `export_review.json`, `approvals.json`, and `publication_plan.json`: privacy/export decisions, approval records, intended audiences, channels, destinations, and required next gates.

Every public claim uses one support status:

- `implemented_behavior`: backed by implemented code, accepted release notes, closed issue, test artifact, screenshot, recording, or other release evidence.
- `mock_or_fixture_behavior`: backed by synthetic, redacted, fixture, or demo-only data and visibly labeled as such.
- `future_plan`: backed by an accepted decision, roadmap item, issue, or future-work note, and visibly not implemented.
- `speculative_goal`: aspirational or exploratory; allowed only when labeled and excluded from implementation claims.

Known limitations are represented as limitations or future-work claims, not as hidden qualifiers on implementation claims. An `implemented_behavior` claim without evidence is invalid for public output.

Media provenance records at least artifact ID, artifact type, source workflow or worker, generator tool, repo commit or build ref, test or demo flow ref, fixture/live/mock mode, input source refs, visible Identity refs, Compartment refs, redaction or minimization applied, hash, capture time, approval state, supported claim refs, retention policy, and export policy.

Approval gates are separate and append-only:

- package assembly may be automatic after source selection and local policy checks;
- public export requires artifact-safety and Compartment/export review;
- script, narration, and caption drafts require human review before being treated as approved public copy;
- video rendering requires explicit approval because it may combine protected media, voice, captions, and public claims into a harder-to-edit artifact;
- platform upload, public posting, mailing-list send, social posting, or any external channel mutation requires explicit human approval unless a narrow trusted auto-publication rule names the workflow, destination, audience, source scope, claim labels, Compartment/export constraints, and rollback or correction path.

Compartment and Identity policy is a hard upper bound. `no_external_export` content cannot enter public packages except as redacted structural references. `no_cloud_llm` content cannot be sent to cloud drafting or video tools. Low-security un-compartmented content may be used only through a user-visible route. Screenshots and recordings must be reviewed for private data, contributor communications, personal data, credentials, private notes, hidden repository context, and unintended Identity disclosure before public use.

Project configurations may define audience-specific communication Objectives. A minimum configuration maps audience labels to Objective refs, intended channels, allowed source categories, required package sections, tone or reading-level guidance, claim-label policy, destination refs, and approval policy. This is configuration over ordinary Objectives, not a new MVP Objective subtype.

Phase 1 includes manual structured packages, claim/evidence registers, approved media references, manual or worker-assisted drafts, contributor calls-to-action tied to real issues or artifacts, export review, approval records, and publication plans. Phase 1 may generate renderer commands or upload instructions as review artifacts, but it must not auto-render videos, upload to platforms, publish posts, send announcements, or mutate external channels.

Post-MVP work includes automated UI screenshot capture, demo-flow export, script generation from repository state, narration or voice generation, caption generation, thumbnail generation, video rendering automation, upload/publication connectors, analytics feedback, and trusted auto-publication policies.

Local renderers, UI-test capture tools, LLM script drafters, TTS tools, caption generators, and thumbnail generators are Automation Workers when they produce candidate artifacts under capability grants without mutating external public channels. YouTube, social, mailing-list, website, app-store, or other public-channel APIs are external publication systems; calls to them are projection or AgentAction workflows with the approval gates above. A combined render-and-upload tool must be split by boundary or treated as an external publication system for the upload step.

**Consequences:**

- Release outreach can proceed through manual packages without waiting for automated video generation or publication.
- Public release artifacts have a stable claim-label and provenance model that prevents mock, future, or speculative behavior from being described as implemented.
- `UBU-Q0063` can reuse release outreach packages as public organizational-introspection evidence.
- `UBU-Q0084` may later refine AgentAction details for external publication connectors without reopening the Phase 1 package boundary.

## UBU-D0181: Calendar preview and Log review use lightweight review annotations

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§4.1.2, 17.8

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0053`.

Calendar preview and Log review are recurring model-maintenance Tasks, not new psychological ontology.

Minimum Calendar preview Task:

- Runs before the first recommended Task in a user-declared work window and after a material Calendar regeneration when UbU is about to rely on the new default Plan.
- Shows the ordered default Plan, assumptions, affect/staleness status, availability, blockers, worker/projection state, and top risk/opportunity.
- Asks whether the Plan is plausible, humane, motivating enough, context-consistent, and executable; user actions are accept, correct model, replan, snooze, skip, or change cadence.

Minimum Log review Task:

- Runs at the end of a work window or at next startup when unreconciled plan/reality differences exist, with a weekly catch-up if routine review is skipped.
- Reviews completed, failed, moot, snoozed, rejected, overridden, and unobserved Tasks plus under-specified time periods.
- Asks what model assumption should be repaired: duration or effect estimate, dependency or precondition, stale affect, interruption, social pressure, unclear Task, changed priority, changed Preference, or Objective fit.

Cadence is stored as ordinary Task recurrence or snooze policy. Phase 1 defaults are per work window or daily for active use, weekly catch-up for skipped reviews, and on-demand review. The user may snooze, skip, disable automatic prompting, or choose per-session, daily, weekly, or manual cadence. Overdue review is a derived report or stale marker, not user blame.

Canonical admission rules:

- Logs: accepted preview/review answers that annotate a Plan, Task, Log entry, or decision use existing `log_annotation_added`, `log_correction_added`, `decision_recorded`, or outcome event payloads.
- Preferences: only explicit accepted pairwise Preference statements become canonical Preferences.
- Snapshots: only current user-declared affect, availability, capacity, or similar observed state becomes a Snapshot.
- Objectives: only user-approved Objective status, importance, scope, or fit changes become Objective updates or annotations.
- Tasks: only accepted lifecycle, estimate, dependency, precondition, decomposition, delegation, recurrence, or cadence changes mutate Tasks.
- Reports: repeated deviation, motivation mismatch, social-pressure pattern, stale affect, overdue review, and expected-execution concerns are derived findings.

Phase 1 does not add canonical fields for autonomy, competence, relatedness, attitude, subjective norms, perceived control, or expected execution. These constructs may appear as prompt labels, structured review-note categories, and derived report tags. They become canonical only through a concrete user-approved update to an existing object type.

Noncanonical review notes include raw free text, unaccepted hypotheses, calibration examples, tentative motivation explanations, subjective norms, social pressure comments, and reactions such as `feels plausible`, `motivating`, or `humane` that the user has not admitted into canonical state. Noncanonical notes may be retained for local review and report generation, but they are not Preferences, diagnoses, Objectives, or durable psychological facts about the user.

Question wording must use model-repair framing:

- ask `What assumption should UbU repair?` rather than `Why did you fail?`;
- ask whether the Plan fits today's context rather than whether the user is committed enough;
- present social-pressure and motivation prompts as optional explanations, not accusations;
- avoid therapy, diagnosis, moral judgment, compliance scoring, or paternalistic language.

**Consequences:**

- Self-determination theory and theory of planned behavior remain interface and reporting influences, not Phase 1 ontology.
- Review Tasks can be implemented with existing Task, Log, Snapshot, Preference, Objective, Report, and recalculation-trigger mechanisms.
- Preference-calibration examples are resolved by `UBU-D0200`; discovery-mode inference is resolved by `UBU-D0201`; deeper affect/personality modeling remains post-MVP in `UBU-Q0074`.

## UBU-D0182: Pipeline state is projection-scoped workflow metadata

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§17.2, 26.2

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0004`.

`pipeline_state` is generic projection-scoped workflow/project-management metadata, not GitHub-specific. Phase 1 uses it first for GitHub issue/PR dogfooding and managed labels.

`pipeline_state` is not stored directly on `Objective` in Phase 1. It is stored in projection metadata keyed by `pipeline_projection_id` and target Objective. One Objective may have multiple current pipeline states across different projections. A projection has at most one current state per Objective; historical changes are represented by Logs.

Minimum record fields:

- `pipeline_state_id`
- `pipeline_projection_id`
- `target_ref` (`Objective` only in Phase 1)
- `pipeline_state`
- `authority_source`
- `source_refs`
- `external_reference_refs`
- `updated_at`
- `version`
- `provenance`

The Phase 1 enum is:

- `unlabeled`
- `invalid`
- `under_specified`
- `valid_unprioritized`
- `unassigned`
- `in_process_awaiting_pr`
- `awaiting_review`
- `awaiting_ci`
- `complete`

`complete` is workflow completion for the projection and does not by itself prove `Objective.status = completed` or `satisfied`.

Automation Workers do not directly mutate `pipeline_state`. A worker may submit a `pipeline_state` projection-state mutation request through `mutation_request.submit`; the canonical instance validates authority, expected prior version, Compartment/export policy, External References, idempotency, and review policy before applying or rejecting it.

Every accepted `pipeline_state` transition creates a `pipeline_state_transitioned` Log entry with old state, new state, projection id, target Objective ref, actor or authority source, reason, effective time, provenance, source refs, external refs, and any requested projection update. Rejected, stale, or unauthorized worker requests are logged through worker mutation rejection events.

**Consequences:**

- Objective lifecycle remains on `Objective.status`; workflow state stays projection-scoped.
- GitHub managed labels project accepted `pipeline_state` values but do not become canonical state.
- Multiple projections can coexist without changing the Objective schema.
- Worker authority remains request-only for pipeline changes.

## UBU-D0183: GitHub analysis work uses parent scope and noise budgets

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27.5

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0006`.

GitHub-derived Objectives and Tasks are admitted only when they reduce uncertainty or create executable work. Every unique in-scope GitHub observation still creates the External Event and Log required by `UBU-D0163`; most observations do not create new Objectives or Tasks.

New Objective admission:

- create a durable Objective only for durable desired state, release scope, or accepted project work not already represented;
- create an analysis Objective only when the investigation cannot be represented as a Task under an existing Objective and has a parent Objective or durable source link, a crisp question, termination condition, owner or review path, source refs, and duplicate key;
- otherwise append the event as evidence to an existing Objective or Task.

Task admission:

- create a Task only for a concrete next action with an actionable completion criterion, such as triage, clarification, review, fix, projection repair, reconciliation, release planning, merge readiness, contributor follow-up, or bounded analysis;
- append evidence to an active equivalent Task instead of creating a duplicate;
- batch low-priority evidence into reconciliation, Calendar preview, Log review, or risk-report refresh when no immediate action is needed.

Analysis Objective duplicate detection uses a normalized key over parent Objective refs, analysis kind or failure class, source refs, affected artifact or GitHub object, unresolved question text, and active or terminal status. A matching active Objective receives appended evidence. A matching terminal Objective is reopened only by a superseding analysis Objective when new evidence materially reopens the question; otherwise the event is logged as duplicate or idempotent evidence.

Analysis Objectives are instrumental. They do not receive independent Preferences in Phase 1. Scheduling value derives from parent Objective refs and is capped by the parent scope. A candidate analysis Objective without a parent or durable source link is under-specified.

Analysis Objectives close through normal Objective transitions. They complete when accepted evidence answers the question or accepts the artifact. They become terminal or make related Tasks moot with accepted reason codes when duplicated, superseded, externally satisfied, obsolete, invalid, or no longer relevant. Closures are logged.

Noise budget defaults:

- one GitHub delivery creates at most one new Objective and one immediate Task unless a human-approved decomposition or worker mutation request creates a Container and child Tasks;
- generated analysis work has a review window, owner or worker assignment path, and stale-after policy;
- repeated equivalent events update External References, Logs, verification metadata, or cache staleness rather than creating more work.

**Consequences:**

- GitHub event handling remains task-oriented and does not turn every comment, label, CI transition, or PR update into management work.
- Analysis work can still be modeled when it is bounded, parent-scoped, deduplicated, and automatically closed.
- Implementations can enforce Objective and Task admission before worker assignment, recalculation, or GitHub projection requests.

## UBU-D0184: GitHub tokens are actor-held scoped credentials

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §27.3.1

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0010`.

Phase 1 GitHub credentials are scoped credential references plus secret material held by the execution actor that performs a GitHub API call. The default MVP path is worker-held credentials: a worker stores its token in its own OS/device secret store, while the canonical UbU instance stores only credential refs, scope metadata, capability grants, projection requests, External References, write results, verification metadata, and Logs.

The canonical instance may hold a local GitHub credential only when it performs a human-approved local projection itself. It does not need to see worker-held tokens and must not store raw GitHub secrets in canonical objects, ContextBundles, Logs, run artifacts, projection payloads, or External References.

Phase 1 GitHub write credentials should use a dedicated GitHub App installation, fine-grained bot/service token, or equivalent service identity for UbU-managed projection writes. A maintainer-owned token is allowed for single-user dogfooding when explicitly configured and logged as that operator's credential. Individual contributor tokens are not shared with the parent instance or other workers; they may be used only by that contributor's own authorized instance or worker.

Credentials must be repository-scoped where GitHub supports it. Task-level authority is enforced inside UbU by capability grants, assignment leases, projection payload allowlists, idempotency keys, and review policy. Short-lived or narrower per-Task GitHub tokens may be used when available, but Phase 1 does not depend on provider-native per-Task tokens.

Every live GitHub write must be verified by re-reading the managed surface and reconciling the observed version or timestamp against the expected projection. API success alone is not confirmation. Unverified or drifted writes remain reconciliation findings until admitted through the normal projection and Log path.

MVP security assumes cooperative operator-administered local and worker enclaves, least-privilege credentials, explicit capability grants, human approval for live writes, append-only audit, and credential revocation/rotation. Phase 1 does not claim to protect a token from a malicious local administrator or a compromised worker that legitimately holds it.

**Consequences:**

- The canonical instance may coordinate GitHub projection without custody of worker-held secrets.
- Worker GitHub authority remains bounded by both GitHub credential scope and UbU capability/assignment scope.
- Repository scope is required when available; Task scope is an UbU authorization boundary unless provider-native short-lived tokens are available.
- Reconciliation and read-after-write verification remain part of the write path.

## UBU-D0185: Authority source is a closed MVP source-path enum

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§17.9, 25.1 — value set and carrier exemption superseded by `UBU-D0226`

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0013`.

`authority_source` is a coarse enum that records the authority/source path for an accepted object, projection state, or candidate mutation. It is not sufficient authorization by itself and does not replace actor Identity, capability grants, External References, expected-prior-version checks, review policy, or Log provenance.

Phase 1 required carriers:

- organization-mode accepted `Objective`, `Preference`, and `Task` records;
- `pipeline_state` projection-state records;
- worker assignment records;
- worker mutation requests;
- external projection requests, previews, and applied projection records;
- Delegation Substrate packets when present.

Ordinary user-mode `Objective`, `Preference`, and `Task` records created directly by the user do not require `authority_source`. Worker, projection, pipeline-state, and mutation-request records require it in any mode that uses those envelopes.

MVP enum values:

- `human_admin`: admin-equivalent human operator or human-approved import/projection action;
- `automation_worker`: Automation Worker submission under a capability grant;
- `github_event`: normalized GitHub event, webhook, fixture, or reconciliation observation;
- `project_policy`: accepted project or organization policy/directive;
- `imported_config`: bootstrap, fixture, or configured import source;
- `llm_advisory`: model-generated candidate/advice; never sufficient authority without admission provenance;
- `user_override`: user-mode explicit override of the current recommendation, Plan, Task choice, or modeled state.

Values are schema-controlled for MVP. Specific Identity, source object, and evidence path belong in surrounding fields such as `actor_identity_ref`, `created_by_identity_ref`, `capability_grant_ref`, `source_refs`, `external_reference_refs`, `provenance`, and the append-only Log entry.

**Consequences:**

- Organization-mode value/work objects now have a closed coarse authority-source vocabulary without introducing RBAC.
- Worker, projection, and mutation envelopes use the same vocabulary across modes.
- `llm_advisory` remains advisory and cannot create canonical state without an admitting actor, review policy, and provenance.
- Future RBAC or richer governance may add role and decision-procedure metadata without rewriting the MVP enum.

## UBU-D0186: Compact Calendar coverage is estimated regeneration metadata

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§16.2, 16.9; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §§2, 4

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0017`.

Phase 1 compact Calendar coverage is an estimate, not an exact proof. It represents covered modeled probability mass within the recorded coverage scope, usually the reactive horizon. Exact coverage proof and complete post-MVP uncertainty coverage are not MVP requirements.

MVP coverage includes only uncertainties represented in the compact grammar or PlanningRequest for that scope:

- duration distributions and correlation groups;
- Task success/failure probabilities when they affect branch reconstruction;
- modeled external-event and interruption assumptions.

Objective recurrence uncertainty is not included in MVP coverage. Evergreen recurrence is evaluated deterministically before generation or repair; probabilistic recurrence may become a later stochastic input.

A compact Calendar stores:

- `coverage_estimate`;
- `uncovered_mass_estimate`;
- `coverage_scope`;
- `coverage_threshold_used`;
- `coverage_inputs_summary`;
- `probability_quality`;
- warning or diagnostic refs when inputs are unmodeled, stale, or degraded.

The default Phase 1 regeneration threshold is `0.99` for short-horizon branch coverage. Policy resolution is: Calendar-specific override, then execution profile or Device policy, then global default. The effective threshold is stored with the compact Calendar so later regeneration decisions are replayable.

When recalculated coverage falls below the effective threshold, UbU records or batches a `low_compact_calendar_coverage` recalculation trigger and includes the finding in risk reporting. The requested action is `recalculate_now` when low coverage can affect the current or next recommended Task, hard feasibility, affect legitimacy, or default Plan; otherwise `mark_calendar_stale` is sufficient. Low coverage does not directly create a canonical Task or worker assignment. Follow-up Tasks or worker work may be recommended only through normal Task admission, worker assignment, and review policy.

**Consequences:**

- Coverage is auditable enough for regeneration without pretending mathematical completeness.
- The same default `0.99` value remains the short-horizon branch target and regeneration threshold unless overridden by recorded policy.
- Objective recurrence uncertainty can be added later as a typed stochastic input without changing the MVP coverage boundary.

## UBU-D0187: Worker retries use failed attempts and retry siblings

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§25.1.2, 27

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0020`.

Phase 1 does not mutate failed worker-created child Tasks back to `active`. A failed attempt remains a failed Task with its own assignment, evidence, and Logs. When retry is warranted, the parent creates a new retry sibling Task with a new `task_id` under the same parent Container or lineage when one exists. The retry sibling carries `retry_of_task_ref`, `retry_root_task_ref`, `attempt_number`, `retry_policy_summary`, `source_failure_log_refs`, and evidence refs.

Worker assignment failure on an existing Task may leave the underlying Task unresolved when no attempt Task was created. In that case retry or repair work is represented by a new assignment or retry/repair Task; accepted completion evidence or mootness is required before the underlying work stops being planned.

The effective retry policy resolves in this order:

- Task or Delegation Substrate packet;
- parent Container or Objective;
- worker or integration default;
- global Phase 1 default.

Worker and integration defaults cannot exceed capability grants, Compartment/export policy, assignment leases, idempotency, expected-prior-version, or review policy. Policy denials, authorization failures, Compartment/export denials, invalid mutation requests, required human review, and stale expected-prior-version conflicts are not automatically retryable.

The global Phase 1 default is at most three total attempts per retry root, including the initial attempt. A policy may set a lower cap or require human review after any failure. Each retry attempt receives its own assignment and idempotency key. Retrying repeats precondition, capability, Compartment, expected-version, and review checks against current state.

Logging uses existing event surfaces:

- failed attempt Task: `task_failed`;
- assignment status change: `worker_assignment_updated`;
- worker request admission or denial: `worker_mutation_submitted`, `worker_mutation_applied`, or `worker_mutation_rejected`;
- retry decision or retry sibling admission: normal Task creation or mutation-request admission path with retry metadata;
- planner impact: `recalculation_triggered` when the failure affects current or next Task, feasibility, worker bottleneck risk, or report validity.

Infinite retry loops are blocked by retry-root attempt caps, idempotency keys, expected-prior-version checks, assignment lease checks, failure-class nonretryability, and human review after cap exhaustion. Exhaustion stops automatic retry creation and routes parent work to human review, clarification, reassignment, repair, or an ordinary Task lifecycle decision such as leaving the latest attempt failed or marking work moot with an accepted reason code.

Worker failure affects derived risk reports. Failed, expired, rejected, repeated, or exhausted worker attempts feed `worker_or_automation_bottleneck` and may affect dependency fragility, deadline risk, release readiness, and recalculation urgency. They do not create canonical Risk objects or silently create follow-up Tasks.

**Consequences:**

- Attempt history remains auditable because failed attempts are preserved instead of overwritten.
- Retry lineage is independent of whether the retry root began as a direct assignment or as an automation child Task.
- Implementations can use a conservative retry default without schema-level infinite loops.

## UBU-D0188: Automation expansion uses Containers with ordinary child Tasks

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§9.4, 24.1.2

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0021`.

Phase 1 Automation/Super Automation expansion uses Task-to-Container restructuring. The outer automation Task is not also the Container. When an accepted worker or parent workflow decomposes automation into canonical children, the parent creates a separate Container with a new `container_id`, records `origin_task_ref` and mutation provenance, and usually moves the original Task to `moot` with `replaced_by_new_plan_structure`.

Child Tasks are ordinary Tasks, normally Dynamic Tasks. Phase 1 does not add an `automation_step` subtype. A child may be Static only when it independently has fixed start and end times under ordinary Static Task rules.

Automation-specific metadata stays in existing envelopes:

- Container lineage/provenance for workflow-level intent, source Task, mutation request, and grouping;
- Task delegation/executor fields or Delegation Substrate packets for child-specific execution intent, expected output, evidence, privacy scope, review, and escalation;
- worker assignment records for lease, status, heartbeat, delivery, and review;
- capability grants, mutation request refs, ContextBundle refs, External References, and Logs for authority, provenance, evidence, and audit.

Workers may propose child Tasks or the restructuring Container only through authorized mutation requests. The canonical parent validates scope, expected prior version, Compartment/export policy, idempotency, review policy, and External Reference changes before admitting canonical children.

Retries use `UBU-D0187`: a failed child remains failed, and retry work is a new sibling Task under the same Container or lineage with retry metadata.

**Consequences:**

- Automation workflows do not require a new WorkItem subtype.
- Plans continue to contain Tasks only; Containers group automation structure and derive completion from child state.
- Worker-created means worker-proposed and parent-admitted, not direct worker canonical write authority.

## UBU-D0189: Phase 1 readiness scoring uses gated derived evidence

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4.1

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0033`.

Phase 1 readiness is a derived planning signal, not canonical release authority. It may inform README or public status text only after human review; it must not by itself mark scope freeze, release readiness, or go/no-go decisions.

Readiness reporting has two top-level scores:

- `scope_freeze_readiness`: how stable Phase 1 design scope is after `UBU-D0097` and `UBU-D0175`.
- `mvp_readiness`: how close the implementation is to a public Phase 1 MVP demo.

Both scores are `0-100` and include evidence refs, last input commit, scorer version, blocking gates, and stale-warning state. The report must also show per-slice status instead of only a single aggregate number.

Required Phase 1 slices:

- bootstrap and seed model;
- GitHub import and External References;
- Objective/Task/UniverseState/Log admission;
- Plan/Calendar generation and explanation;
- next-action focus plus feedback/recalculation;
- risk and human-complete plan-quality reports;
- Compartment, worker, and projection authority boundaries;
- GitHub projection preview or approved write plus reconciliation;
- release outreach and public dogfooding artifact package when relevant.

Default `mvp_readiness` weights:

- 15 scope and blocker discipline;
- 25 implementation slice coverage;
- 15 user-facing loop evidence;
- 15 integration/projection/worker/privacy boundaries;
- 15 verification, fixtures, and deterministic tests;
- 10 dogfooding/artifact/public-claim evidence;
- 5 operational polish and contributor-run diagnostics.

Score caps:

- no solved Phase 1 scope-freeze decision: maximum 39;
- any hard consistency failure in canonical files: maximum 49;
- any unresolved `UBU-D0175`-certified blocker for the reported slice: maximum 69;
- no runnable end-to-end dogfooding loop: maximum 59;
- missing or failing Compartment/export, worker-authority, or GitHub-projection hard-boundary checks: maximum 74;
- public demo or outreach claims without evidence labels: maximum 79;
- no human-reviewed readiness report: maximum 89.

Readiness bands:

- `0-39`: design or consistency not stable enough for implementation signal.
- `40-59`: implementation skeleton exists, but no reliable end-to-end loop.
- `60-74`: private dogfooding candidate with known blockers or boundary gaps.
- `75-89`: public-demo candidate requiring human review and polish.
- `90-100`: MVP readiness candidate; release and scope-freeze claims still require human approval.

A readiness report must name blockers, failing gates, stale inputs, manual assumptions, fixture/mock/live-data boundaries, and the next implementation slice most likely to raise the score. Model-committee may compute the report and propose README readiness text, but it must not update derived public readiness signals automatically.

**Consequences:**

- README readiness signals derive from an evidence-backed report, not from raw open-question count or model confidence.
- Readiness is judged slice-by-slice after `UBU-D0175`; unresolved post-MVP or nonblocking questions do not reduce Phase 1 readiness unless they carry a valid blocker certificate.
- Human review remains required before public readiness claims, release decisions, or scope-freeze claims.

---

## UBU-D0190: Automation eligibility uses three governance classes

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.7.1

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0035`.

`Auto-choice eligibility` classifies how much authority model-committee automation has over an open-question answer. It is separate from answerability, automation-likelihood, importance, and risk. Automatic selection remains advisory; canonical acceptance still requires ordinary human repository review and commit.

Allowed values:

- `Auto eligible`: automation may rank, propose, validate, score, and select a review candidate when dependencies, consistency, validators, quorum, and patch checks pass. Use only for bounded, mechanically reviewable work under accepted constraints.
- `Human approval required`: automation may draft, decompose, score, and prepare review artifacts, but the run must mark the result human-review-required. Use for durable schema/API/data-model decisions; security, privacy, Compartment, Identity, authority, worker, projection, relationship, affect, public-claim, release-outreach, or MVP-blocker decisions.
- `Human only`: automation may summarize, detect inconsistencies, ask clarifying questions, or prepare option memos, but it must not auto-select an answer. Use for project-owner directives, scope freeze, release/go-no-go, licensing or IP changes, funding acceptance, roadmap or mission pivots, legal commitments, public commitments, and overrides of failed consistency, quorum, disagreement, or validation gates.

Classification rules:

- Answerability remains the first gate. A blocked question is ineligible for ordinary answering regardless of automation class unless its dependencies are solved in the same work item.
- Automation-likelihood ranks questions only after answerability and automation eligibility are known.
- Unknown or mixed cases use the stricter class.
- A model-generated patch may not lower an existing question's human-involvement class without human review.
- A new `UBU-D0175` blocker certificate is `Human approval required` unless it also creates a `Human only` commitment.

**Consequences:**

- Future question ranking can distinguish answerability, automation likelihood, and governance eligibility instead of treating them as one score.
- New or updated open questions should carry the strictest applicable `Auto-choice eligibility` value.
- Human-only and human-approval-required work may still benefit from automation, but only as bounded review support.

## UBU-D0191: UbU's root product is individual life logistics

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§1, 2.3.1, 4

UbU's core motivation is to help individual human beings plan and implement life logistics. Organizational coordination, project management, Association introspection, and marketplace behavior are important emergent properties of the same model, but they are not the root purpose.

The first Phase 1 MVP remains GitHub dogfooding because that is the bootstrapping path available to the project, not because UbU is primarily a developer project-management tool. Public and contributor-facing language should avoid implying that organizational introspection replaces user introspection or that organizational coordination is the center of the product.

**Consequences:**

- Resource and Skill modeling are central product directions even if delayed by bootstrapping.
- Derived outreach documents should keep the personal life-logistics purpose visible.
- Organization-mode and Association features should be framed as downstream or emergent from the user-sovereign planning model.

---

## UBU-D0192: Resource is a core life-logistics abstraction with a thin Phase 3 boundary

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§4, 10.4

Resource is a first-class long-term abstraction for task readiness. It represents physical, digital, legal, financial, informational, access-controlled, location, tool, and consumable prerequisites whose state affects whether a Task can begin, continue, or complete.

Resource development is delayed from Phase 1 because of the bootstrapping development process, not because Resource is peripheral. UbU should try to include a thin Resource-aware task-readiness layer in Phase 3, provided it does not expand into full inventory or financial management before release.

Phase 3 Resource scope should answer: what must be true about the world for this Task to be realistically executable? Minimal fields may include identifier, name, kind, availability state, location or access hint, owner Identity, Compartment, and notes. Task resource requirements may mark a Resource as required, helpful, blocking start, or blocking completion.

Full inventory control, procurement automation, subscription management, bank syncing, investment tracking, receipt OCR, depreciation, tax categorization, double-entry accounting, and Quicken-like financial workflows are Phase 3B/Phase 4+ full-version-1.0 features or later, not Phase 3A requirements.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0114` should no longer describe Resource as merely post-MVP.
- Phase 1 schemas should avoid blocking later Resource predicates.
- The MVP-facing Resource feature is task readiness, not asset management.

---

## UBU-D0193: Skill is an Identity-owned rust-prone capability predicate

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§10.5, 21.7

Skill should be a first-class object. A Skill is an Identity-owned capability that can satisfy Task dependencies, unlock Techniques, reduce risk, reduce cost, improve quality, or make a DIY path available.

Skills can be learned, tested, evidenced, improved through practice, and allowed to rust over time. A Skill claim should carry provenance or evidence appropriate to its use. Self-declared evidence may be sufficient for private planning, while public, delegated, or marketplace-visible claims need stronger evidence and confidence semantics.

Skills should support fields such as owner Identity, proficiency level, confidence, verification status, last used time, last tested time, rust model, prerequisite Skills, unlocked Techniques, evidence references, and Compartment.

**Consequences:**

- Task readiness must eventually consider both external Resources and embodied Skills.
- `Skill` should not be collapsed into a free-text tag or marketplace profile.
- The private Skill model should precede public Skill Barter.

---

## UBU-D0194: Techniques can form a real-life capability graph and skill tree

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§10.6, 21.7

A Technique is a reusable procedure that transforms Resources, Skills, time, attention, and other preconditions into an Objective-serving result. A Technique can require Skills, consume or transform Resources, test or reinforce Skills, produce new Resources, and unlock later Techniques.

A large UbU-run or UbU-compatible Technique database should be treated as a premier future feature. It can allow the user to select or automatically schedule Skill-learning Tasks that unlock DIY work, maintenance, professional labor skills, and future Skill Barter opportunities.

The skill-tree analogy is useful when grounded in real evidence and real capability rather than fake points. UbU can gamify real life by making capability acquisition visible, schedulable, inspectable, and economically meaningful.

**Consequences:**

- Technique database design should connect Resource requirements, Skill requirements, learning paths, verification criteria, risk, cost, and failure consequences.
- TaskFactories should remain compatible with Resource and Skill requirements.
- Outreach may use “gamifying real life” when it explains that the game mechanics correspond to real-world capability and evidence.

---

## UBU-D0195: DIY-versus-purchase/hire/barter tradeoff is a core planning comparison

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §10.6

Resource and Skill modeling create a natural comparison between buying a replacement, hiring a professional, doing the work oneself, learning first and then doing the work, bartering Skill, or deferring.

UbU should eventually compare these alternatives using time cost, money cost, affect cost, risk, consequence of failure, Resource availability, Skill level, Skill rust, learning value, future unlocks, and marketplace or barter value.

This tradeoff supports economic self-sufficiency without forcing the user toward DIY. Hiring, buying, or deferring may be the correct decision when risk, affect, time, legal constraints, or quality requirements justify it.

**Consequences:**

- Financial management should connect to Objectives, Tasks, Techniques, Resources, and Skills rather than start as a standalone ledger clone.
- User-facing recommendations should not moralize DIY; they should explain tradeoffs.
- Regulated or dangerous domains need careful evidence, risk, and external-provider boundaries.

---

## UBU-D0196: Skill Barter should be an open user-sovereign skill economy direction

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §21.7

Skill Barter should build on the private Skill model, Resource/Skill readiness, Delegation Substrate, Identity, Association, evidence, and Compartment boundaries. It should not be presented as a Phase 1 marketplace, a token-first product, an illicit market, or a platform-captive closed ecosystem.

Preferred framing is an open, user-sovereign skill economy or a self-reinforcing ecosystem for skill acquisition, task execution, and voluntary exchange. Users should become more capable inside and outside UbU, not locked into UbU.

**Consequences:**

- Skill Barter outreach should emphasize voluntary coordination, economic self-sufficiency, lifelong skill acquisition, privacy, pseudonymous capability, and lawful exchange.
- Reputation and evidence questions remain open for later phases.
- Marketplace operation should not delay private Resource/Skill usefulness.

---

## UBU-D0197: Phase 3B and Phase 4+ are the full version 1.0 release track

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4

Phase 3 should be treated as the bridge from MVP/bootstrap work into the full product. Phase 3A may contain minimal Resource/Skill-aware task readiness and narrow Identity coordination that are still close to MVP expansion. Phase 3B and Phase 4+ represent the full version 1.0 release track.

Phase 3B should expand user-facing Resource, Skill, Technique, DIY-versus-purchase/hire, and capability-graph features enough that UbU begins to feel like the intended life-logistics product. Phase 4+ may add mature inventory, Quicken-like financial extensions, public or federated Skill Barter, reputation/evidence, dispute workflows, and broader marketplace features.

**Consequences:**

- Phase 1 remains implementation-first and must not absorb Resource/Skill scope.
- Phase 3 planning should explicitly separate thin readiness features from full inventory, finance, and marketplace systems.
- Full version 1.0 messaging can emphasize life logistics, real-world capability acquisition, and Skill Barter direction without promising those features in Phase 1.

---

## UBU-D0198: Counterfactual decisions use decision_recorded payloads

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §17.0

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0107`.

MVP counterfactual logging uses the existing `decision_recorded` Log event type. It does not add separate event types for every rejected candidate. A `decision_recorded` entry is required whenever UbU presents a meaningful user-facing option, warning, proposal, alert, or recommendation and the user rejects, dismisses, overrides, bypasses, or ignores it.

Required `decision_kind` values:

- `plan_candidate_rejected`;
- `task_suggestion_dismissed`;
- `suggestion_declined`;
- `system_recommendation_overridden`;
- `worker_proposal_declined`;
- `safeguard_advisory_bypassed`;
- `alert_dismissed_or_ignored`.

Minimum `event_payload` records:

- `presented_ref` or compact redacted `presented_candidate_summary`;
- available actions and the observed `user_action`;
- chosen and rejected refs when applicable;
- optional `reason_capture`;
- system-state refs in `decision_context`;
- whether the entry is eligible for future preference inference.

User-stated reasons are never mandatory. `reason_capture.reason_source` is one of `user_stated`, `user_selected_code`, `system_inferred`, or `none_given`; inferred reasons are review notes, not canonical Preferences.

Counterfactual decision entries are append-only. Later Preferences, Task changes, Objective changes, safeguard policy changes, worker reassignments, annotations, or corrections may cite the decision Log ref, but they do not rewrite the original decision entry.

Preference inference may consume only uncorrected counterfactual entries and must distinguish stated, selected-code, inferred, and missing reasons. Absence of a counterfactual entry is not evidence of user acceptance.

**Consequences:**

- Introspection and preference inference have reviewable evidence for rejected options, not only accepted outcomes.
- Optional reason prompts can stay lightweight without losing the fact of the decision.
- No new Log event type is required beyond `decision_recorded`.


## UBU-D0199: Question decomposition reduces design burden, not question count

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§3.6, 3.7

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0040`.

Model-committee evaluates decomposition by unresolved design burden, not raw open-question count. A burden estimate combines:

- dependency burden: unresolved dependency count, dependency depth, and blocker status;
- ambiguity burden: mixed decision types, vague scope, missing acceptance criteria, or unclear authority class;
- automation burden: automation-likelihood, validator availability, patchability, risk, and human-involvement class;
- implementation burden: whether the question blocks a concrete Phase 1 slice, hard invariant, needed contract, or persistent schema choice.

Answerability is a hard gate for ordinary answering:

- no dependencies, solved dependencies, or dependencies answered in the same work item: eligible;
- unresolved dependencies outside the work item: not eligible for ordinary answering;
- blocked questions may be selected only for decomposition or consistency repair.

A decomposition is valid when replacement questions:

- preserve the parent's intent without expanding scope;
- are narrower and have clear decision type, phase, priority, dependencies, automation class, blockers, and resolution conditions;
- include lineage metadata, using `Decomposes: UBU-Qxxxx` or equivalent metadata once parser support exists;
- reduce total burden, dependency depth, ambiguity, risk, or automation difficulty;
- produce at least one answerable replacement now, or clearly shorten the path to answerability.

A parent question may be marked decomposed only when accepted replacement questions are canonical and the parent no longer needs ordinary answering as one unit. It may be marked solved only when an accepted decision answers the parent. Until parser support for decomposed status and lineage metadata exists, leave the parent open unless an accepted decision resolves it.

Work scoring rewards valid decomposition when it lowers burden or unlocks immediate work, even if open-question count rises. It penalizes proliferation that creates vaguer, harder, more coupled, dependency-heavier, or lineage-free questions.

The `UBU-D0175` stop rule applies to replacement questions. A replacement question is not an MVP blocker unless it includes a valid blocker certificate. Dependency-reducing decomposition is preferred over waiting when it can create answerable work without violating accepted dependencies, hard invariants, or file/schema consistency.

**Consequences:**

- Raw open-question count is not used as the stop rule or decomposition score.
- Blocked questions can be selected for decomposition, but not ordinary answering.
- Future parser work may add first-class decomposed-status and lineage fields without changing the scoring rule.

## UBU-D0200: Phase 1 preference calibration uses six neutral example frames

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§2.2.1, 4.1.2, 8.6

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0051`.

Phase 1 preference calibration is a small prompt library, not a new canonical value object or hidden utility model. The minimum library has six neutral example frames:

- urgent external commitment versus important but nonurgent Objective;
- emotionally costly repair, clarification, or maintenance work versus easier visible progress;
- socially pressured request versus planned user-chosen Objective;
- recovery or rest versus another useful Task;
- short-term relief or cleanup versus long-term capability, relationship, or project importance;
- decomposition of ambiguous work versus starting a larger unclear Task.

Presentation budget:

- Bootstrap shows at most two examples by default, after the user has named real Objectives or candidate Tasks.
- Calendar preview shows at most one relevant example for the Plan being previewed.
- Log review shows at most one relevant example for an unreconciled rejection, override, failure, or repeated deviation unless the user asks for more.
- Skipping calibration is allowed; UbU records only the ordinary note or decision evidence needed for review.

Each example is tagged with one or more Phase 1 calibration dimensions: `urgent_value`, `emotional_cost`, `social_pressure`, `recovery_value`, `long_term_importance`, and `ambiguity_value`. These tags explain the tradeoff being surfaced; they are not utility components.

Admission rules:

- accepted explicit pairwise Objective comparisons become Preferences;
- current affect, availability, capacity, or recovery reports become Snapshots or UniverseState facts when they describe observed current state;
- preview/review explanations for outcomes, rejections, overrides, or calibration interactions become Logs, Log annotations, or Log corrections;
- Objective-importance comments without pairwise order become Objective annotations or noncanonical review notes;
- raw feelings, social-pressure comments, skipped examples, and unaccepted hypotheses remain noncanonical review notes.

Neutrality rules:

- use actual user Objectives or Tasks when possible;
- present plausible costs and rewards for both sides;
- provide `neither`, `indifferent`, `not applicable`, edit, and free-text paths;
- avoid preselected answers, hidden scoring, therapy, diagnosis, moral judgment, and "should" language;
- disclose that examples are prompts for self-reporting, not UbU's values.

Examples are versioned derived content. UbU may revise or retire an example when corrections, skips, edits, repeated non-use, or review feedback show that it is confusing, leading, or unhelpful. Historical Logs stay append-only; only future example presentation changes.

**Consequences:**

- Preference calibration can improve onboarding, Calendar preview, and Log review without adding a psychology ontology or canonical value objects.
- Phase 1 onboarding remains lightweight because calibration has a strict presentation budget and can be skipped.
- Future richer examples may be added as versioned prompt content without schema migration unless they change admission rules or canonical fields.

## UBU-D0201: Discovery mode uses reviewable evidence and explicit override admission

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§4.1.2, 12.2, 17.8

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0052`.

Discovery mode is a user-selectable workflow state, not an instance mode and not always-on surveillance. It is off by default. The user may start, pause, resume, exit, inspect, reject, delete where retention policy permits, correct, defer, or accept collected evidence. UI must show active capture state, enabled sources, routing status, retention limits, and pending-review count.

Phase 1 session states are `inactive`, `active`, `paused`, `ended`, and `pending_review`. Discovery observations are stored as reviewable candidate artifacts, not final truth. A minimal evidence item records session ref, effective time or interval, source kind, signal kind, payload ref or redacted summary, confidence, Compartment or low-security label, provenance, and review status.

Allowed Phase 1 inputs are narrow:

- explicit quick notes, user-selected current action, intentional voice/text notes, and manual start/stop markers;
- UbU app state, Task controls, Calendar or default Plan context, timers, focus state, and explicitly enabled foreground app category or app identifier;
- configured integration events already allowed by existing External Event and External Reference policy;
- coarse motion state, coarse user-defined location category or geofence event, and basic device state such as screen or network state.

Excluded by default: covert continuous microphone, camera, screen recording, keystroke logging, raw message bodies, raw file contents, raw GPS trails, and cross-Identity sharing. Later use of any excluded source requires a separate explicit mode, Compartment review, routing disclosure, and user approval.

Admission rules:

- accepted actual actions that reconcile planned intervals use `plan_realized`; accepted Task outcomes also write `task_completed`, `task_failed`, or `task_moot`;
- overrides of a recommendation write `decision_recorded` with `decision_kind = system_recommendation_overridden`, `authority_source = user_override`, chosen action or Task when known, optional reason, and a planner-relevant `user_override` recalculation trigger;
- user-declared observed state becomes a Snapshot only when it asserts current state such as affect, availability, capacity, or location category;
- Preferences change only through explicit accepted pairwise Preference statements; repeated behavior and inferred reasons are not Preferences;
- Task estimates, dependencies, status, Objective annotations, or Objective status change only through user acceptance or normal validated admission; otherwise the evidence remains an unresolved review item.

Undetailed time periods must preserve uncertainty. Review may mark a period as `unknown`, `private`, `rest`, `interruption`, `planned_task`, `different_task`, `quick_note`, or `other`. UbU must not infer Preference changes, Objective failure, habit patterns, or moral meaning from unknown or private time.

Before treating repeated behavior as a habit pattern, UbU asks a clarification prompt: `I have seen this pattern more than once: [behavior] during [context]. Should UbU plan around it, help you change it, treat it as not a pattern, or leave it unresolved?` Valid answers are `endorse_and_plan_around`, `tolerate_but_review`, `unwanted_help_change`, `not_a_pattern`, and `leave_unresolved`.

**Consequences:**

- Discovery mode can support mobile evidence gathering without converting sensor inference into canonical truth.
- Overrides are authoritative user evidence, but durable model changes still pass through explicit Log, Snapshot, Preference, Task, Objective, and recalculation admission rules.
- Habit-pattern inference requires user clarification before it affects planning as a stable pattern.

## UBU-D0202: Evergreen gap-fillers are ordinary Dynamic Task suggestions

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §§9.3.1, 15.4, 16.4, 16.6

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0057`.

Phase 1 does not add an evergreen Task subtype or `GapTask`. An evergreen gap-filler is an ordinary active Dynamic Task, usually linked to an evergreen Objective, with a `gap_fill_policy`. The planner considers it only after Static Tasks, predetermined Dynamic Tasks, dependencies, preconditions, legitimization support, recovery, and transition buffers are respected.

Minimum Phase 1 `gap_fill_policy` fields:

- `eligible`;
- `minimum_useful_duration_seconds`;
- `maximum_useful_duration_seconds`;
- `cooldown_policy`, including explicit `none_declared` when no cooldown applies;
- `autonomy_mode`, fixed to `suggest_only` in Phase 1.

Optional fields:

- `preferred_duration_seconds`;
- `location_scope`;
- `required_context_refs` for material, device, app, integration, or broad location state;
- `affect_suitability`;
- `rank_hint`.

Existing Task fields provide Objective link, duration, title, active status, recurrence or reactivation linkage, dependencies, preconditions, effects, and provenance. Location, material, device, and integration requirements should use ordinary preconditions when they affect readiness.

Gap-fill selection ranks candidates by fit to the gap, Objective-derived value, due cadence, readiness, affect suitability, expected affect delta, cooldown, setup/teardown cost, and recent user snooze/reject/override evidence. Calendar preview, Log review, affect collection, lightweight cleanup, reflection, review queues, meditation, and relationship-maintenance prompts can all use the same representation.

Phase 1 gap-fillers are suggestions outside the default Plan. Accepting or starting one records ordinary Task execution or decision evidence and may trigger recalculation. A gap-filler must not crowd out recovery, meals, sleep, transition buffers, setup/teardown, deadline-fragile prerequisites, Static Tasks, or a user-declared desire to keep the gap open.

The reactive branch layer may compute a small ranked suggestion set when early completion leaves a gap before the next Static Task and no predetermined Dynamic Task can be pulled forward. Future versions may add Gap Tasks, trusted auto-insertion policies, Technique-generated maintenance Tasks, richer Resource/Skill readiness, and stochastic Objective recurrence.

**Consequences:**

- Phase 1 implementation can support useful spare-time suggestions without adding a WorkItem subtype or making idle time a planning failure.
- Calendar preview and mobile next-action UX can explain why a gap is protected, discretionary, or has an optional suggestion.
- Later richer maintenance automation remains compatible with ordinary Task, Objective recurrence, and planner behavior.

## UBU-D0203: Adaptive planning granularity uses explicit execution profiles

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.7

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0058`.

Compact Calendar runtime chooses from configurable execution profiles. Phase 1 default presets are:

- `full_detail`: 60-second delta, 3600-second reactive horizon, `0.99` branch coverage target;
- `mobile_moderate`: 300-second delta, 3600-second reactive horizon, `0.99` branch coverage target;
- `mobile_low_power`: 900-second delta, 1800-second reactive horizon, `0.95` branch coverage target;
- `offline_steward`: 900-second delta, 1800-second reactive horizon, `0.95` branch coverage target, with precomputed branches and local repair metadata.

The one-, five-, and fifteen-minute deltas are presets, not schema constants. Calendar policy, Device policy, user settings, and runtime conditions may override delta, horizon, coverage target, and compute budget. The effective values are stored with the compact Calendar or PlanningRequest for replay and explanation.

Coarser switching is allowed for `low_battery`, `low_power_mode`, `thermal_pressure`, `offline`, `expected_offline_window`, `heavy_workload`, `user_setting`, `external_worker_unavailable`, and `compute_budget_exceeded`. Finer switching is allowed when power, temperature, connectivity, worker availability, idle time, or user settings permit it. A switch records its reason in runtime or compact Calendar metadata. If it can affect the current or next recommendation, hard feasibility, affect legitimacy, or coverage threshold result, UbU records or batches a recalculation trigger using an existing trigger kind. No new Phase 1 trigger kind is required.

A coarser-profile explanation must show the active profile, switch reason, effective delta, reactive horizon, coverage target or estimate, expected loss of precision, guarantees still in force, and how the user can request more detailed planning or wait for a finer-capability backend.

Known offline windows trigger precomputation when connectivity and compute are available. The precompute package should cover the declared offline window plus the current reactive horizon when feasible. It stores the default Plan, last legitimate Plan, decision envelopes, Task criticality, cached explanations, simple repair recipes, and high-probability branch materialization or reconstruction instructions up to the effective coverage target. Precomputation is bounded by battery, thermal, user, Compartment, and compute-budget policy.

Cached branches expire when accepted Logs, Snapshots, External Events, elapsed time, or user actions leave their decision envelopes; when dependencies, preconditions, Static Task constraints, affect assumptions, or coverage become invalid; or when the branch passes its recorded expiry. Expiration falls back to the last legitimate Plan, local repair, clarification, or stale marking.

The minimum mobile-only guarantee is the core UbU loop on one local device: explicit state, one next Task or clarification Task, explanation, conservative hard-constraint checks, affect/staleness and coverage-degradation disclosure, feedback Logs, and local repair for the current or next Task. Mobile may reduce granularity, coverage, analysis depth, and LLM-assisted features; it may not hide a mandatory external compute dependency.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0073` can define exact mobile stewardship schemas and repair recipes on top of this profile policy.
- Low-power or offline degradation is user-visible and auditable rather than a silent quality change.
- The default `0.99` coverage target remains normal/full-detail policy; low-power and offline profiles use explicit profile overrides.

## UBU-D0204: Phase 1 organizational introspection uses manual outreach retrospectives

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4.1.4

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0063`.

Phase 1 organizational introspection uses the EthConf/outreach workflow in `DESIGN.md §4.1.4`: an evidence-backed retrospective and follow-up plan over existing UbU project records, not full Association automation.

Accepted constraints:

- Use existing Phase 1 objects and artifact packages: Objectives, Tasks, Logs, External Events, External References, public dogfooding review packages, Release Outreach packages, export review, and candidate AssociationAttestations.
- Manual and fixture-backed work is acceptable when live outreach notes, contact details, or private communications are unsafe to publish.
- Candidate attestations remain reviewable candidates until human approval, whether hand-authored or produced by a local or policy-allowed LLM.
- Public artifacts expose only redacted summaries, evidence selectors, hashes, public links, reviewed claims, approved follow-up Tasks, and recorded evidence gaps.
- Private notes, raw contact details, unapproved conversation content, private funding terms, private relationship hypotheses, and Compartment-protected payloads are not public artifacts.

**Consequences:**

- Organizational introspection can be demonstrated without first implementing Association objects, dispute semantics, multi-user sync, or automatic archive analysis.
- EthConf follow-up becomes a dogfooding case with auditable mission-alignment evidence instead of a marketing-only activity.

## UBU-D0205: Canonical use-case statement and capability framing

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §1, README.md

The canonical UbU use-case statement is:

> UbU helps an individual user solve everyday life problems by transforming a desired outcome into a legitimate, executable plan. It does this by modeling the current state of the user's life, the desired state, required Tasks, available and missing Resources, available and missing Skills, reusable Techniques, affect and energy constraints, financial tradeoffs, public or marketplace options, expert-guided alternatives, and evidence from execution.

The canonical use-case formula is:

> **Objective + Current State + Constraints + Resources + Skills + Techniques + Preferences + External Options → Legitimate Plan**

The deeper philosophical framing is:

> UbU helps people build the capabilities, resources, routines, and relationships needed to actually live the life they choose.

This makes UbU a **capability engine for real life**, not merely a scheduler or task manager.

**Consequences:**

- Public-facing files should use the canonical statement and formula when introducing UbU to new audiences.
- The capability framing strengthens the product identity and distinguishes UbU from adjacent tools.

## UBU-D0206: Government and public-resource symmetry is a design invariant

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.3.1

Any institution that can constrain a user's plan may also provide Resources, permissions, remedies, or procedures that improve the user's plan. UbU must model both sides.

UbU should not only surface regulations, permits, and legal constraints. It should also identify and plan around grants, subsidies, benefit programs, weatherization assistance, workforce training, legal aid, public infrastructure, hardship waivers, appeals, enrollment windows, and other government- or community-supported Resources.

Many public Resources are conditionally unlockable: they become available only after the user completes prerequisite actions such as applying for a benefit, collecting documents, filing a form, or requesting an accommodation. UbU should represent these as conditional Resource availability states and generate the prerequisite Tasks automatically.

**Consequences:**

- UbU avoids being one-sided: it is not only a constraint-modeling system but also a resource-discovery and entitlement-navigation system.
- The benefits navigation and public-program access use cases become natural extensions of the Resource model.
- This is particularly important for users in economic precarity, life transition, or unfamiliar institutional environments.

---

## UBU-D0207: Library and Community Resource Mode is a named feature direction

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.3.1, OUTREACH.md

Libraries, tool libraries, makerspaces, public workshops, repair cafés, seed libraries, and community resource centers should be treated as Resource providers in UbU's planning model.

Strong marketing lines for this feature direction:

> **UbU turns your library card into a real-life skill tree.**

> **Borrow the tool. Learn the skill. Do the project. Keep the capability.**

> **Own less. Do more. Learn more. Waste less.**

This feature supports the public-good, frugality, sustainability, self-sufficiency, and life-upgrade narratives and democratizes access to Resources previously available only to those with money or social capital.

**Consequences:**

- Community Resources become first-class planning inputs alongside owned, rented, and purchased Resources.
- The Library and Community Resource Mode is a Phase 3B product hook that requires no new ontology — it is an application of the existing Resource model to a new category of providers.

---

## UBU-D0208: Expert-Guided DIY and Technique Commissioning are first-class product concepts

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.3.1, OPEN_QUESTIONS.md

UbU should support a middle tier between generic guides (Tier 1) and hiring a professional to do the whole job (Tier 3):

> **Tier 2: Expert diagnosis + custom Technique Package — paid, specific to the user's actual situation.**

A **Technique Request** is submitted by the user with evidence about their specific problem: photos, measurements, model numbers, symptoms, skill level, available tools and Resources, budget, time window, and risk tolerance.

A **Technique Package** is returned by a skilled expert: diagnosis, parts list, tool list, step-by-step instructions calibrated to the user's skill level, safety warnings, verification criteria, and the conditions under which to stop and hire a professional.

This is not generic AI advice. It is AI-orchestrated expert delegation that produces a custom executable Technique for the user's actual situation. A skilled person can sell diagnosis and instructions as a distinct economic product, separate from labor.

**Consequences:**

- A new marketplace primitive emerges that does not exist in current platforms: situated expert knowledge packaged as an executable artifact.
- Retired tradespeople, experienced professionals, and domain experts can monetize knowledge without physical labor.
- Users gain access to expert guidance at a fraction of a full service call.
- New open questions should be added for the Technique Request and Technique Package schema.

## UBU-D0209: Task-driven Resource Exchange is a named strategic direction

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.3.1, SOVEREIGN_COORDINATION.md, FUNDER_BRIEF.md

The Resource abstraction should extend to all access modes: owned, borrowed, rented, bought, sold, leased, bartered, or reserved Resources. This creates a planning primitive distinct from existing search-driven marketplaces:

> **"I need access to Resource X, near place Y, during time window Z, below price P, because it unlocks Task T."**

The key distinction is:

> **Task-driven markets, not search-driven markets.**

Existing marketplaces start from search. UbU's Resource Exchange starts from the user's plan. The access method is generated from the plan's needs, not from a keyword query.

UbU can compare: borrow free from a neighbor or library; use a tool library; rent locally; buy used; buy new; hire someone who already owns it; barter; learn the Skill and use a shared Resource; delay the Task; or cancel the Task.

**Staging:**
- Early: UbU recommends external options (library, Craigslist, rental shop, Home Depot).
- Middle: UbU helps create listings and bids ("Need tile saw Saturday 10am–4pm").
- Later: UbU-native task-aware marketplace with bids, reservations, escrow, condition records, and reputation.

**Consequences:**

- The Resource Exchange becomes a named Phase 3B/4+ direction distinct from the Skill Barter marketplace.
- Ethereum fits naturally as the settlement and trust layer beneath a task-driven Resource and Skill exchange.

## UBU-D0210: Skeleton Plan failures use bounded diagnostics and blocking clarification

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.2.2; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §4

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0070`.

Skeleton generation must not continue into ordinary optimization when no valid skeleton baseline exists for the current Calendar scope. It returns a bounded `SkeletonFailureDiagnostic` and asks for clarification or a user choice.

MVP `failure_class` values:

- `missing_starting_state`;
- `impossible_dependency`;
- `cyclic_dependency`;
- `static_task_collision`;
- `insufficient_calendar_window`;
- `unavailable_resource`;
- `blocked_external_event`;
- `unknown_precondition`.

The diagnostic payload records diagnostic ID, severity, failure class, affected Task refs, missing or conflicting state, relevant time-window or Static Task refs, initial UniverseState ref, source or External Event refs, a compact causal chain, safe alternatives, prompt policy, and a short non-blaming user-facing summary.

Default explanation budget is the failed Task or state, the immediate cause, and at most three causal-chain steps. Full dependency/precondition detail stays one inspector action away.

Safe alternatives are limited to providing or correcting starting state, marking the state already satisfied, adding a prerequisite Task, relaxing a deadline or Static constraint, extending the planning horizon, removing or mooting the blocked Task, choosing an already-modeled alternate Technique or Task path, waiting for or recording an External Event, or manual decision. UbU must not invent canonical Resources, Skills, Techniques, Preferences, or external facts just to repair skeletonization.

Use `immediate_blocking_prompt` when the failure prevents a valid baseline for the current Calendar, current or next recommendation, Static Task placement, hard dependency/precondition, deadline feasibility, required Resource, or required External Event. Use `planning_warning` only when a valid skeleton still exists and the failed chain is outside the current recommendation path or future horizon; then record the diagnostic and mark the relevant Calendar, explanation, or risk report stale.

**Consequences:**

- Skeleton failure is model repair, not low-quality optimization.
- User clarification can produce explicit state updates, Task changes, Plan repair, or manual decisions through normal admission and Log paths.
- Implementations can validate failure handling through the `SkeletonFailureDiagnostic` payload in `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`.

## UBU-D0211: Semi-legitimization prunes candidates before full legitimacy validation

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.2.2; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §4

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0071`.

Phase 1 treats full legitimization as a finalist oracle. Full legitimization must run for the legitimized skeleton baseline and for any Plan that can become the default Plan. It does not run inside every high-fan-out candidate-construction step unless implementation measurements show it is cheap enough.

Full legitimization includes exact or conservative validation of Calendar Logic, dependencies, preconditions, affect limits in `user_mode`, required recovery, breaks, meals, sleep, rest, transition buffers, setup and teardown time, context-switch limits, slack thresholds, dependency-fragility thresholds, support Task or buffer insertion, and user-facing diagnostics.

Semi-legitimization is the cheap prevalidation layer. The MVP heuristic set is sufficient:

- affect budget;
- slack preservation;
- dependency fragility;
- user-mode compatibility;
- local repair viability;
- legitimacy-delta estimate against the legitimized skeleton baseline.

Semi-legitimization returns `passes_cheap_checks`, `reject_obvious`, or `needs_full_legitimization`. It may prune obvious failures and rank candidates, but it cannot certify a default Plan. Any uncertain or selected candidate requires full legitimization before default selection.

Legitimacy is both binary and graded. Binary legitimacy is the validity gate: `passed`, `failed`, or `needs_clarification`. Graded legitimacy fields such as `legitimacy_score`, `legitimacy_margin`, and `legitimacy_delta_from_baseline` are advisory ranking and explanation signals only.

A high-value brittle Plan may beat a lower-value humane Plan only after full legitimization passes and minimum slack, local repair envelope, affect margin, destructive-pressure, and post-plan-state checks pass. Objective value cannot buy down hard legitimacy failure. If no richer candidate clears that bar, the default remains the lower-value humane finalist or the legitimized skeleton baseline.

Recuperative work required for legitimacy is not optional gap-filling. Meals, sleep, rest, breaks, recovery, setup/teardown, transition buffers, affect collection, and checkpoint work inserted or protected by legitimization are ordinary Tasks or buffers with explanation lineage, protected criticality, and support refs. Optional `gap_fill_policy` suggestions are considered only after that support work is protected.

**Consequences:**

- Candidate search can use cheap pruning without making semi-legitimization a hidden validity oracle.
- Full legitimacy remains CPU-certified before default Plan selection.
- Planner scoring can compare humane and brittle Plans without treating hard human-viability constraints as ordinary utility penalties.
- Recuperative Tasks are represented through ordinary Plan support work, not as evergreen gap-fillers.

---

## UBU-D0212: Phase 1 planner solver selection uses CPU certification

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.10; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §2

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0072`.

Phase 1 planner backend selection uses a mandatory CPU certification layer and optional advisory accelerators.

Mandatory CPU responsibilities:

- dependency DAG and topological-order validation;
- deterministic precondition and UniverseState effect evaluation;
- skeleton validity and bounded contradiction diagnostics;
- full legitimization and semi-legitimization admission;
- hard Calendar Logic validation, provenance validation, payload-safety validation, and final Plan commit.

Advisory acceleration responsibilities:

- PyTorch GPU execution for `skeleton_sampling`, `affect_legitimacy_filter`, `value_scoring`, and `monte_carlo_rollout`;
- PyTorch or CPU local-search experiments for candidate optimization and ranking;
- learned-model inference only as advisory candidate ranking or parameter estimation until the CPU layer admits the output.

Solver/library candidates are evaluation targets, not Phase 1 dependencies:

- built-in CPU graph/precondition validator: required reference path and certification source;
- OR-Tools CP-SAT: optional finalist schedule-feasibility and contradiction-minimization experiment;
- Z3 or comparable SMT/MaxSMT: optional logical contradiction-diagnosis experiment;
- additional local-search libraries: optional candidate-optimization experiments only.

Phase 1 has no mobile GPU target and no cloud GPU provider target. The required mobile fallback is CPU stewardship for current/next Task hard checks, cached last-legitimate Plan repair, decision envelopes, and simple repair recipes, with exact mobile metadata deferred to `UBU-Q0073`. Premium or cloud GPU planning is deferred to `UBU-Q0059` and later provider work; any future backend must preserve the same request/response contract, Compartment/export gating, and CPU certification on return.

No solver, GPU backend, or learned model may write canonical state or certify final validity. If optional solver output and the CPU validator disagree, the CPU validator blocks commit and records diagnostics.

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0072` is resolved for Phase 1.
- Solver benchmarking becomes implementation work rather than an open design blocker.
- Mobile GPU, cloud GPU, and premium wide-horizon provider details remain deferred without blocking the local desktop/laptop Phase 1 backend.

## UBU-D0213: Evergreen recurrence gains a calendar-style schedule with exceptions

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §7.4.1

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0125` (partial; recurrence representation).

The MVP `maintenance_time_decay` recurrence field cannot express scheduled recurrence with named exceptions, such as "Mondays at 09:00, except holidays, when it moves to the next day at 08:00." Phase 3 extends evergreen Objective recurrence with a calendar-style schedule modeled on the RFC 5545 (iCalendar) base-rule-plus-exception pattern.

The schedule carries an RRULE-shaped base rule, EXDATE-shaped exclusions, RDATE-shaped additions, override entries for occurrences that differ in time or parameters, and an optional enablement window (start and end date/time).

The schedule is deterministic: evaluating it against a timezone and exception set yields a fixed occurrence series. This preserves the existing rule that evergreen recurrence is evaluated deterministically before Calendar generation. Stochastic recurrence remains a separate future extension and is out of scope.

The schedule lives on the evergreen Objective, not on a new object. An evergreen Objective whose recurrence yields no resolvable occurrences, or that lacks a default Technique for expansion, is a philosophical-consistency finding surfaced for user correction during ordinary review, not a hard logistical block, unless it prevents a required baseline.

**Consequences:**

- Cadence references that previously pointed at `Task.recurrence` move to this schedule (see `UBU-D0214`).

---

## UBU-D0214: `Task.recurrence` is eliminated; recurrence lives on the evergreen Objective

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §7.4.1, §9

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0125` (partial).

`Task.recurrence` is removed from the Task field set as an over-design. Scheduled recurrence is a property of the evergreen Objective (`UBU-D0213`); a recurrence schedule reactivates the Objective, and planning synthesizes fresh Task instances per reactivation (`UBU-D0216`). This gives recurrence a single source of truth.

Cascading edits:

- Calendar-preview and Log-review cadence now adjust through the recurrence rule on their evergreen system Objectives rather than ordinary Task recurrence.
- Relationship-maintenance cadence already lives on an evergreen Objective's recurrence rule and is unaffected in substance.
- Streak tracking (`UBU-Q0111`) is simplified: recurring-completion chains are counted per evergreen Objective rather than per recurring Task.

**Consequences:**

- Tasks are pure instances; they do not carry their own recurrence.
- `UBU-Q0111` subquestion on per-Task versus per-Objective streak attribution resolves toward per-Objective.

---

## UBU-D0215: `TaskFactory` is eliminated; Technique instantiation into a Container subsumes it

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.2.1.1; OPEN_QUESTIONS.md `UBU-Q0115` tombstone

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0115`.

`TaskFactory` is removed as an over-design. Its role — expanding a template into a set of Tasks, dependency edges, and an Objective structure — is already provided by Technique instantiation, which expands a Technique's Steps into a Container of child Tasks with intra-Technique edges. A second object doing the same work is redundant.

Recurring project scaffolding, the use case `UBU-Q0115` reserved for TaskFactory, is served by an evergreen Objective with a calendar-style recurrence schedule (`UBU-D0213`) whose reactivations drive Technique-based expansion (`UBU-D0216`).

**Consequences:**

- `UBU-Q0115` is closed as resolved-by-elimination.
- No new template object is introduced; expansion reuses Technique, Step, Container, and Objective.

---

## UBU-D0216: Objective-to-Task expansion runs pre-kernel; technicalizing is candidate generation, not skeletonization

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.2.1.1, §16.3.1

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0125` (primary).

Phase 3 specifies how an Objective expands into the work Tasks that satisfy it — the long-acknowledged gap of Technique-generated Tasks. The expansion stage ("technicalizing") selects a Technique for each in-scope Objective and instantiates its Steps into Tasks.

Placement and boundaries:

- Expansion runs **pre-kernel, on the CPU side**, before skeletonization. It does not run inside the planning kernel. In-kernel expansion would break the fixed `task_graph` input, the CPU-owned topological order, the request schema, and the kernel's determinism and no-I/O contract (the last violated the moment Technique selection consults an advisory LLM).
- Default expansion is deterministic: the Objective's default Technique instantiates the baseline Task set, feeding the deterministic default-Plan path.
- Technicalizing — selection among alternative Techniques — is a candidate-generation and value-scoring concern, not a skeletonization concern. Skeletonization continues to do only dependency affixing and ordering.
- Synthesized Static Tasks enter skeletonization; synthesized Dynamic Tasks carry decision envelopes and are placed during candidate generation. No new placement machinery is required.
- Instantiating an already-modeled Technique's Steps is not "inventing a Technique" and does not violate the no-invention rule. Technicalizing and any advisory LLM select only among already-modeled Techniques. Novel Techniques remain the user-approved Expert-Guided DIY / Technique Commissioning flow (`UBU-D0208`).
- If synthesized Tasks have prerequisites, the pipeline is a bounded expand/skeletonize fixpoint with an explicit iteration cap, not a single pass. Exact bounds are open (`UBU-Q0125`).

**Consequences:**

- The §15.2.2 no-invention rule is preserved as a guardrail on technicalizing, not weakened.
- The kernel request/response contract and CPU certification boundary are unchanged.

## UBU-D0217: Revealed preference is a proposal, not a fact; automatic selection is confidence- and authority-gated

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.3.1

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0125` (partial); related to `UBU-Q0074`.

When UbU presents competing candidate Plans and the user selects one, that choice is a proposal about the user's trade-offs, not a canonical fact. It may propose a weight or Preference update surfaced for explicit user acceptance; it must never silently rewrite the user's trade-off vector. This is an axiom: UbU does not decide values for the user.

Supporting constraints:

- A single choice is a weak signal (one inequality in weight-space) and must be accumulated conservatively.
- Trade-offs are affect- and state-conditioned; learned weights are a function of current state, not a fixed global vector.
- Eventual automatic selection requires two gates in series: a confidence threshold and a user-granted, revocable auto-choice authority. Confidence alone never authorizes automatic selection. The model is `Auto-choice eligibility` as a governance gate separate from automation-likelihood, plus the trusted-auto-publication pattern.
- Auto-selected choices remain logged, inspectable, and overridable.
- Affect-conditioned introspection findings may surface an observed correlation and offer a context remedy (change when and how a decision is made), but must not assert a psychological mechanism, blame the user, or nudge toward the option UbU scores higher.

**Consequences:**

- The trade-off-comparison engine cannot become an autonomous value-setting system.
- Confidence and authority are kept as separate gates.

## UBU-D0218: Multi-Technique candidate comparison uses bounded branch-and-bound and surfaces outcomes, not utils

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §16.3.1

Resolved question: `UBU-Q0125` (partial); demand-side driver for `UBU-Q0119`.

When more than one already-modeled Technique can satisfy an Objective, candidate generation may produce competing Plans that differ by Technique and compare their predicted real-world outcomes for user choice.

Required properties:

- **No cross-product enumeration.** The full `k^N` Technique cross-product contradicts the bounded-search commitment. The required shape is branch-and-bound with semi-legitimization (`reject_obvious` / `passes_cheap_checks`) as the cheap pruner; only a small Pareto-frontier finalist set reaches full legitimization and full scoring. Dominance is a bound during search, not a post-enumeration filter.
- **Full-vector dominance.** A candidate dominates only if at least as good on every outcome axis, including robustness, affect-margin, dependency fragility, and Plan probability — not only money and time. Cheaper-but-more-fragile candidates are not dominated.
- **Surface outcomes, not utils.** The user sees concrete predicted terminal UniverseState (money, time, Resources, affect, relaxation, Plan probability), not a util scalar. Money is a generic cost outcome only; account identity, balances, and overdraft analysis require a financial model deferred to Phase 3B/4+.
- **Cognitive load and cadence.** The comparison reuses the Calendar-preview UX surface and roughly its choice counts; diverging is a user configuration. Within-noise finalists are presented as a tie with a `sensitivity_summary`, not a manufactured ranking.
- This engine is the demand-side driver for the Technique database (`UBU-Q0119`): more Technique variety widens the achievable outcome frontier.

**Consequences:**

- Adding outcome axes increases scoring sensitivity (many-objective dominance resistance and ranking instability under noise); robust multi-objective ranking under uncertainty is flagged as open research in `UBU-Q0125`.
- The killer-feature framing is "see and choose across every axis," not "maximize all axes," which have no joint maximum.

## UBU-D0219 — External identity-and-access standards posture

**Status:** Accepted

UbU adopts external identity-and-access standards — IAM — by layer, with deliberately asymmetric treatment: a standard used for external interoperability is surfaced verbatim at the boundary, and a standard used only as an internal engine stays below the design vocabulary.

**SPIFFE/SPIRE is a conformance target (outward-facing).** It is adopted at the Delegation Substrate, federation, marketplace, worker, hosted-planning, boundary-agent, and commercial-wire boundary so that workload identity, execution provenance, and authority evidence are cryptographically attestable and externally auditable. SPIFFE terms — trust domain, SPIFFE ID, SVID, node/workload attestation, federation — appear unaliased at that boundary. SPIFFE represents UbU-controlled workloads, worker instances, Devices when exposed as execution enclaves, Compartment-scoped boundary agents, hosted services, and delegation endpoints. It does **not** replace human Identity or user-sovereign Identity.

**OPA is an implementation substrate (inward-facing).** OPA may realize the policy checker, but its terms — Rego, PDP, PEP, bundle, and especially "decision" — are realization notes only and must not enter core vocabulary. OPA can return structured policy outputs, but conventional allow/deny authorization patterns are the wrong product vocabulary for UbU's graduated model. OPA must not flatten semi-legitimization, full legitimization, needs-clarification states, or bypass-as-introspection-evidence into a boolean gate.

**SAML/OIDC is boundary-only.** External enterprise authentication may be supported at the commercial wire when required, with OIDC/OAuth2 preferred for greenfield federation. External IdPs never become the source of truth for user-sovereign Identity.

- `authority_source` and the **claim register** keep their names. At a boundary, `authority_source` may be backed by one or more verifiable claims, including an SVID identifying the executing workload or boundary agent. The SVID authenticates the workload; UbU capability grants, Log provenance, Compartment policy, task-specific `authority_scope`, and review/admission rules establish whether that authenticated actor is authorized for the action.
- **IdentityAttestation** is workload/boundary-agent evidence unless explicitly bound to a human-approved authority path by UbU-native provenance. It must not merge with **AssociationAttestation**.
- SPIFFE IDs, SVIDs, trust-domain names, federation bundles, issuance logs, and boundary telemetry are potentially correlating identifiers. Any SPIFFE/SPIRE profile must treat namespace shape, SVID lifetime, bundle exposure, logging, and federation scope as privacy-critical design parameters.
- The trust-domain-to-Compartment granularity choice is left open as `UBU-Q0126` and must consider at least three candidates: one sovereign trust domain, per-Compartment trust domains, and a hybrid control-plane root with purpose-scoped / pairwise / Compartment-scoped boundary federation.
- No SPIFFE, SPIRE, OPA, OIDC, SAML, SVID issuance, enterprise federation, or commercial-wire identity implementation is required for Phase 1 dogfooding.

## UBU-D0220 — Directional authority

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.19

Authority and intent originate at the individual and flow outward into coordination, never inward. This is the invariant that distinguishes a legitimate social outgrowth of self-governance from self-governance absorbed into a coordination platform; from the schema alone the two are nearly indistinguishable, and only the direction of authority separates them. The invariant constrains the multi-scale coordination directions (`UBU-D0222`, DESIGN.md §32): Associations, Delegations, super-connectors, and marketplaces are legitimate only while authority continues to originate at the individual.

---

## UBU-D0221 — Eject-not-override for shared-authority compartments

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §23.6

For any Compartment whose policy is not solely user-set, sovereignty is preserved at the device boundary rather than at the field level. The user can always destroy or eject such a Compartment wholesale, but cannot selectively override its external policy while retaining that Compartment's data. A voluntarily-accepted, always-destroyable container keeps the sovereignty claim intact; a Compartment the user cannot destroy is the line at which UbU would become the thing it opposes. This invariant gates the protective-compartment direction (`UBU-D0222`) and any shared-authority coordination (DESIGN.md §32.5).

---

## UBU-D0222 — Named multi-scale and sovereign-coordination strategic directions (Phase 3+)

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §32

The following are accepted as named strategic directions, presented as substantive rather than speculative, with implementation deferred to Phase 3+ / the full-product track and explicitly not Phase 1 commitments: concurrent multi-scale coordination, super-connectors, attention sovereignty, coordination with worker standing, and protective shared-authority compartments (DESIGN.md §23.6). They are reasons the data model stays general and must not be used to over-scope the MVP. Governance-as-an-emergent-subsystem is recorded here as the present scope boundary on these directions: UbU does not solve governance; it supplies honest data boundaries, Compartment control, and a settlement-agnostic Delegation Substrate, and communities layer their own governance on top. The protective-compartment direction is additionally gated by `UBU-Q0127` and by eject-not-override (`UBU-D0221`).

---

## UBU-D0223 — Cloud and premium compute is leak-minimization, not leak-elimination

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §32.6

Any cloud computation leaks proportional to its duration through access patterns, timing, and resource profile; FHE protects the plaintext, not the side channels. A long-horizon premium planning run, including a prospective UbU Corp premium tier, is the largest instance of a leak the architecture already accepts when it is bounded and consented. Documentation must name the residual leak as residual and require it to be ephemeral and Compartment-scoped, rather than implying a zero-leak guarantee that "local-first, inspectable" could be misread as making.

---

## UBU-D0224 — Feature-to-data map as a planned full-product legibility artifact

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §3.11

Alongside bootstrap-dependency build ordering, the project maintains a feature-to-data map: for each feature, the data components it actually invokes at runtime versus those merely present in the model. It is a legibility instrument that makes "this feature needs nearly everything" falsifiable, prevents quiet scope creep, and gives reviewers a precise dependency picture per slice. It is a planned full-product artifact, not a Phase 1 deliverable.

---

## UBU-D0225 — Competitive positioning against AI calendar and scheduling assistants

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §31

UbU is differentiated first positively: AI auto-schedulers take the user's to-do list and events as given and optimize their placement (the *when* of an already-decided *what*), whereas UbU is the generative goal-and-values layer that originates *what belongs there at all* from goals, values, affect, and resources, working from introspected rather than inferred sensor state. The defensibility claim is an incentive argument, not a capability one: an incumbent could build local-first but will not, because matching UbU's sovereignty means abandoning the pooled-corpus data asset its model depends on, and a partial "private mode" delivers a promise where UbU delivers a verifiable architecture. Public messaging must avoid the absolute "they cannot," frame it as "structurally disincentivized," tie it to the running demo and open repository, and calibrate by audience: `WHAT_IS_UBU.md` carries only the positive category line with no competitor names or accusations; `SOVEREIGN_COORDINATION.md` and `FUNDER_BRIEF.md` carry the full incentive/verifiability argument.

---

## UBU-D0226 — AuthoritySource is a pure authority-path enum; information source moves to provenance

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §17.9; DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md §8, §13, Appendix A; docs/PHASE1_CONTRACT_BOUNDARIES.md. Supersedes the `UBU-D0185` value set and carrier exemption; the `UBU-D0185` principles — a coarse closed enum that is never sufficient authorization by itself — stand.

`authority_source` records only the authority path for an accepted object, projection state, or candidate mutation. The closed Phase 1 enum is: `user`, `user_override`, `delegated`, `automation_worker`, `policy`, `system`. `user` is ordinary direct user authority. `user_override` is reserved for explicit user override of a proposed, delegated, automated, policy, or system-derived action, including overrides of the current recommendation, Plan, Task choice, or modeled state. `delegated` names an authority path and is unrelated to the `delegated` moot reason code (DESIGN.md §9.5), which is retained unchanged.

Information-source distinctions formerly carried as enum members move to provenance: GitHub events, bootstrap/fixture/configured imports, and model-generated origins are represented in `Provenance.source` / `source_refs`, which remain required wherever DESIGN.md requires source-path visibility, including projection reconciliation. Model-generated content is never an authority path: advisory candidates acquire authority only at admission, from the admitting actor, with the model origin recorded in provenance. `human_admin` maps to `user` in single-user Phase 1 and to `delegated` where a distinct administrator acts; `project_policy` maps to `policy`; `github_event` and `imported_config` map to `system` with the source in provenance.

Carrier rule: every admitted canonical record carries `Provenance.authority_source`. The `UBU-D0185` exemption for ordinary user-mode records is removed; its honest value is `user`. This also corrects the prior guidance that ordinary user-driven actions default to `user_override`.

**Consequences:** DESIGN.md §17.9 is rewritten to this vocabulary. The §24.1 SPIFFE mapping row is unchanged and remains accurate: the field name is unchanged, and authority still requires capability grants, `authority_scope`, Compartment policy, Log provenance, and admission checks. `DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md` examples and Appendix A actor/provenance guidance are corrected. Automation, policy, and system authority sources are never unconstrained user-equivalent authority.

---

## UBU-D0227 — Task readiness states are derived views, not canonical status

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9.5; docs/PHASE1_CONTRACT_BOUNDARIES.md

The canonical Task lifecycle is `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `moot` per DESIGN.md §9.5, with `moot_reason_code` as the existing closed enum. Readiness and execution states such as proposed, ready, blocked, and in-progress are derived: candidacy is the store's candidate/admitted distinction; ready and blocked are computed from dependencies and deterministic precondition evaluation; in-progress is `active` plus recorded start evidence in the Log. Derived readiness may appear in API responses, UI, and reports but must not be persisted as canonical Task status. `canceled` is not a canonical status; the specific moot reason code is used instead.

**Consequences:** the `ubu-schemas` `task-status` schema is corrected to the canonical lifecycle and gains the `moot_reason_code` closed enum; `ubu-core`, `ubu-store`, `ubu-orchestrator`, and `ubu-ui` references to derived states are reworked as views.

---

## UBU-D0228 — Phase 1 wire convention: snake_case JSON field names

**Status:** Accepted → ubu-schemas `CONTRACT.md`; docs/PHASE1_CONTRACT_BOUNDARIES.md

All Phase 1 JSON wire and schema field names use snake_case, matching the literal field vocabulary of `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` and `DEVICE_SYNC_AND_COMPARTMENT_CONTRACT.md` (`authority_source`, `schema_version`, `request_id`, `moot_reason_code`, and the rest). Enum values are snake_case. Rust types mirror the wire through serde rename conventions, and the serde-to-schema lockstep enforces the convention in fixtures and CI. This applies to `ubu-schemas`, `ubu-core`, and every consumer; generated TypeScript types follow the wire names.

**Consequences:** the current camelCase fields in `ubu-schemas` and `ubu-core` are corrected before any consumer code grows; Phase 2 sync statements require no casing translation layer.

---

## UBU-D0229 — Phase 1 ID-registry expansion to all fifteen object types

**Status:** Accepted → ubu-schemas id registry (single machine-readable source of truth per docs/PHASE1_CONTRACT_BOUNDARIES.md)

Six prefixes are added so that every Phase 1 canonical object type is admissible: `pref_` → Preference; `container_` → Container; `ustate_` → UniverseState; `identity_` → Identity; `rel_` → Relationship; `xevent_` → External Event. Each uses the existing prefixed lowercase unhyphenated UUIDv7 suffix pattern. The registry in `ubu-schemas` remains the single machine-readable source of truth; this record authorizes the closed-set change. The current `universe-state` schema models a snapshot view rather than a facts container; the UniverseState facts schema is first-slice implementation work under DESIGN.md §4.1.6.

**Consequences:** the `ubu-core` `ObjectType` enum and `ubu-store` admission mappings are extended in lockstep.

---

## UBU-D0230 — Compartment guardrails as policy-summary members with a logged boundary decision

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §4.1 guardrail list; ubu-schemas `policy-summary`

The Phase 1 Compartment guardrails `local_only`, `no_cloud_llm`, and `no_external_export` are closed policy-summary members rather than free-form labels. Every enforcement-gate evaluation of these members that blocks, permits with conditions, or redacts writes an append-only `compartment_boundary_decided` Log entry carrying the Compartment ref, the member evaluated, the adjudication result, actor Identity, `authority_source`, reason, effective time, and provenance. The event name follows the existing Log vocabulary pattern (`objective_transitioned`, `pipeline_state_transitioned`, `decision_recorded`).

**Consequences:** the `ubu-schemas` `policy-summary` schema and the Log event vocabulary gain these members; the free-form Compartment label remains for naming, not for policy.

---

## UBU-D0231 — Orchestrator state is the ubu-store admission boundary; MemoryState is eliminated

**Status:** Accepted → docs/PHASE1_CONTRACT_BOUNDARIES.md; ubu-store `PHASE1_STORE_CONTRACT.md`; ubu-orchestrator. Implements the Phase 1 local state contract and admission vocabulary established by `UBU-D0226`, `UBU-D0227`, `UBU-D0229`, and `UBU-D0230`.

The `ubu-orchestrator` holds no canonical state of its own. The ephemeral in-memory `MemoryState` carried by the scaffold is removed: the orchestrator opens `ubu-store` on startup from a configurable database path, applies or verifies migrations, and serves every canonical read and write through the store. Candidate-versus-admitted status is the store's distinction, not an orchestrator status, and admitted Objectives, Tasks, Log events, and the other canonical object types are persisted only through store admission, which carries `Provenance.authority_source`. Derived readiness states (`UBU-D0227`) may appear in API responses but are never persisted as Task status. `schema_version` is validated and echoed end to end, and an unknown or missing version returns a structured diagnostic at the API boundary rather than panicking. The loopback HTTP surface remains a temporary transport pending the Phase 2 Tauri command bridge and is not a security boundary; this record adds no session, CSRF, or per-request token defenses.

**Consequences:** `MemoryState` and the in-memory maps it backed are deleted from `ubu-orchestrator`, which now depends on `ubu-store` at a pinned rev. The `ubu-devshell` fixture smoke test (`scripts/run-fixture-demo.sh`) is repointed at the store-backed orchestrator against a throwaway, isolated store, so the cross-repo smoke test exercises the admission boundary rather than an in-memory path. This record retires the scaffold's ephemeral-state placeholder; it does not expand Phase 1 scope, add Phase 2 replication, or implement the user-facing loop.

---

## UBU-D0232 — Phase 1 next-action selection is a deterministic readiness-ordered skeleton rule with explicit action recording

**Status:** Accepted → docs/PHASE1_CONTRACT_BOUNDARIES.md; ubu-orchestrator; ubu-ui; ubu-devshell. Builds on `UBU-D0227` (derived readiness), `UBU-D0210` (bounded skeleton diagnostics), and `UBU-D0226` (authority paths).

The Phase 1 next-action recommendation is a deterministic, readiness-ordered selection over admitted Tasks, not planner output. Readiness is derived per `UBU-D0227`: candidacy is the store's admitted-versus-candidate distinction, and ready and blocked are computed from dependencies and deterministic precondition evaluation. The single recommended Task is chosen by an explicit priority order with a stable tiebreak, and readiness is never persisted as Task status. The recommendation carries a deterministic, templated explanation referencing the parent Objective, the readiness state, and provenance `source_refs`; the explanation is never model-generated and never asserts affect-legitimization, optimization, or planner provenance. When no Task is ready, the result is a bounded diagnostic per `UBU-D0210`, not an opaque empty response.

Recording a user action against the recommendation is an explicit canonical write through store admission. `complete` transitions the Task to the canonical `completed` status with `authority_source = user`; `override` records rejection of the recommendation with `authority_source = user_override` per `UBU-D0226`. Each action admits an append-only Log event with provenance. An optional `snooze` records a defer Log event only and does not implement snooze-aware readiness. This selection rule is a Phase 1 skeleton that the planning kernel subsumes once it exists; it must not be mistaken for planner output, and it adds no affect weighting, Calendar, or recalculation.

**Consequences:** `ubu-orchestrator` gains `next_action` selection, the templated explanation, the bounded empty/blocked diagnostic, and the action-recording endpoint; `ubu-ui` renders the next-Task view with act and override over loopback; the `ubu-devshell` fixture smoke test exercises the full onboard-to-act loop store-backed and offline. Where the Log event vocabulary lacks a dedicated task-transition member, action recording uses `decision_recorded` pending a separate decision to add a closed-enum member; no closed enum is extended without its own ticket. This record retires the *no runnable end-to-end dogfooding loop* readiness cap; it adds no planner, Calendar, projection write, or recalculation.

---

## UBU-D0233 — GitHub projection is preview, per-batch approval, gated worker write, and reconciliation with conflict surfacing

**Status:** Accepted → ubu-orchestrator; ubu-github-adapter; ubu-ui; ubu-devshell. Implements `UBU-D0159` for Phase 1 and conforms to the frozen `ubu-schemas` projection family (`projection-preview`, `projection-operation`, `projection-approval`, `projection-result`, `projection-reconciliation`, `github-label-write`).

GitHub projection in Phase 1 is a four-stage flow: a deterministic, side-effect-free preview of the managed-label operations UbU would write; an explicit per-batch approval of the whole preview; a worker write that emits only after approval; and reconciliation that reads observed state back and compares it against the last applied projection. There is no auto-write: nothing leaves the machine without an explicit approval. The write is restricted to managed labels only — it never touches issue bodies, comments, open/close state, or non-managed labels — and is a constrained worker action recorded with `authority_source = automation_worker` per `UBU-D0226`, never user-equivalent authority. GitHub is not canonical: reconciliation produces a `matched`/`drifted`/`missing` result and, on divergence, surfaces a conflict for the user rather than silently overwriting in either direction; an external change the user accepts is admitted through store admission with GitHub provenance. Projection-layer records (preview, approval, result, reconciliation) are persisted durably for auditability, distinct from canonical-object admission.

**Consequences:** `ubu-github-adapter` provides a mockable managed-label write and reconciliation read; `ubu-orchestrator` exposes preview, approval, gated write, and reconciliation; `ubu-ui` renders the preview diff, the per-batch approve control, the projection result, and conflict surfacing over loopback; `ubu-devshell` exercises the preview → approve → write → reconcile loop offline against a mock GitHub backend. Phase 1 verifies projection against a mock, not live GitHub; live writes and non-label surfaces are deferred. This record refines `UBU-D0159` into the Phase 1 implementation; it adds no planner, Calendar, or recalculation.

---

## UBU-D0234 — External export is gated by a single authoritative deny-by-default boundary with worker-authority and redaction-identity invariants

**Status:** Accepted → ubu-core; ubu-orchestrator; ubu-devshell. Extends `UBU-D0230` (Compartment guardrails as policy-summary members with a logged boundary decision) from a recorded decision into an enforced runtime chokepoint.

Every export-class operation — in Phase 1, a GitHub managed-label write — passes a single authoritative enforcement gate before it can emit. The `ubu-core` Legitimizer is the only adjudication path and the only issuer of an export permit; the permit is constructible solely by the gate on an `Accepted` legitimization, so permission to emit cannot be fabricated by a caller and no orchestrator code path can reach an external write without it. Adjudication is deny-by-default: an export-class operation is rejected when the effective Compartment policy cannot be resolved, when `local_only` or `no_external_export` forbids export, or when the legitimization is not `Accepted`. Two invariants are enforced at the gate: the worker-authority invariant rejects user-equivalent authority (`user`, `user_override`) on the export path, permitting only `automation_worker` per `UBU-D0226`; and the redaction-identity export-boundary invariant forbids Compartment names and labels from crossing a denied boundary in denial surfaces or emitted payloads. Every adjudication, allow or deny, writes a `compartment_boundary_decided` Log entry built from the Legitimizer's payload as the single source of truth.

**Consequences:** `ubu-core` owns the gate, the export permit, the worker-authority and redaction-identity checks, and a deny-by-default property-test suite; `ubu-orchestrator` routes all projection export through the core gate, holds no duplicate adjudication, and makes the adapter write reachable only by presenting a permit, with bypass-resistance tests; `ubu-devshell` runs the deny path and the export-boundary, worker-authority, and redaction checks as standing contributor diagnostics. Redaction-identity is enforced on the export path here, with full cross-cutting serializer coverage left as a named follow-up. This record makes the `UBU-D0230` boundary real at runtime; it adds no new export classes and does not implement `no_cloud_llm` enforcement, which has no cloud-LLM call to gate in Phase 1.

---

## UBU-D0235 — The Phase 1 Plan is a canonical timed artifact regenerated by override-safe recalculation

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15, §16, §29; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md; ubu-schemas (`planning/plan-step`, `planning/plan`); ubu-planning-kernel; ubu-orchestrator; ubu-ui; ubu-devshell. Refines `UBU-D0124` (legitimization makes skeleton Plans human-viable), `UBU-D0151` (Compact Calendar grammar), and `UBU-D0227` (canonical Task lifecycle and derived readiness).

The Phase 1 Plan is canonical, persisted, and auditable, not a derived render. The timed schedule is represented in canonical state: `plan-step` carries optional `start`, `end`, and `static_anchor` placement fields, so the placements the user sees are themselves auditable, while the `Calendar` object (`cal_`) continues to model only availability windows. A Plan carries the `candidate`/`admitted`/`rejected`/`superseded` status lifecycle and an optional `supersedes_plan_id` link. The legitimized skeleton is the human-viable baseline (`UBU-D0124`); affect legitimization, value scoring, and stochastic rollout are layered on later per `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` without changing this representation.

Recalculation regenerates rather than mutates. Each accepted immediate recalculation trigger (§29) maps to a planning-kernel repair scope — `local`, `remaining_window`, or `full_window`, defaulting to `remaining_window` — and the kernel runs in `mode = repair` with a `repair_context` identifying the prior Plan and the observed divergence. The repaired Plan supersedes the prior Plan, linking `supersedes_plan_id` and marking the prior Plan `superseded`, preserving a replayable planning history.

Recalculation is override-safe. A recalculation must not re-place completed or in-progress Tasks (`UBU-D0227`) and must not clobber a user-override placement: a placement carrying `user_override` (`UBU-D0226`) is preserved, and the planner repairs around it rather than over it. The operator role is never rented to automation; the sovereignty invariant holds inside the planner.

**Consequences:** `ubu-schemas` extends `plan-step` with optional `start`/`end`/`static_anchor` and `plan` with optional `supersedes_plan_id`, additively and under this decision; the planning kernel emits the canonical timed Plan and supports `mode = repair`; the orchestrator persists the canonical Plan and wires the recalculation trigger to repair-mode planning with override-safe supersession; the UI renders the Compact Calendar (`UBU-D0151`) of the timed Plan; the devshell fixture demo asserts override-safe recalculation. This record authorizes the additive schema change; it does not add affect, scoring, or rollout, which are layered on in later planning phases, and it does not yet repoint the `UBU-D0232` next-action rule at the Calendar.

## UBU-D0236 — Affect legitimization is the Phase 1 human-viability filter via sigmoid affect constraints

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §13, §15.2.2; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §6; ubu-schemas (`planning/affect-profile`, `core/snapshot` affect observation, planning-response legitimization fields); ubu-planning-kernel; ubu-orchestrator; ubu-ui; ubu-devshell. Refines `UBU-D0124` (legitimization makes skeleton Plans human-viable) and builds on `UBU-D0235` (canonical timed Plan).

Affect legitimization is the Phase 1 filter that makes a skeleton Plan human-viable. The affect model separates two concerns. An **AffectProfile** holds the user's tolerances per dimension — `direction`, `location` (the 0–10 point where satisfaction is 0.5), `scale` (the positive sigmoid slope), `threshold` (the feasibility cutoff in `[0,1]`), and an optional `freshness_seconds` — and is built from the bootstrap affect-calibration answers, with documented bootstrap defaults marked as temporary review priors. An **affect observation** (in `core/snapshot`) holds the current state — a per-dimension `value` on the 0–10 scale, a `source_kind` of `live_observation` or `bootstrap_default_profile`, and `observed_at`. The profile is the standing tolerance; the observation is the point-in-time reading. The `core/snapshot` affect block is therefore observation-only: the sigmoid parameters that previously lived on the observation move to the AffectProfile, and any per-observation display deltas are not the planning feasibility model.

For a current affect value `x`, each active dimension's satisfaction is `sigmoid((x - location)/scale)` for `higher_is_better` and `sigmoid((location - x)/scale)` for `lower_is_better`, per `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` §6. Phase 1 directions are `energy = higher_is_better`, `stress = lower_is_better`, and `mood_intensity = lower_is_better` (arousal/volatility, not valence); the prior `core/snapshot` fixture that recorded `mood_intensity` as `higher_is_better` was an error and is corrected to `lower_is_better`. A candidate is affect-feasible only if every active dimension meets its threshold at the CPU-selected aggregate evaluation point; the filter records per-dimension satisfaction, an `affect_margin`, the `violated_dimensions`, and a legitimization result of `passed`, `failed`, or `needs_clarification`. The filter runs in `enforce` for user-facing planning and `warn_only` for onboarding, test, and stale or missing affect. A missing or stale observation (older than `freshness_seconds`) uses the bootstrap default profile with a marked warning or `warn_only`, never silently presented as current measured state. The `mood_intensity` `lower_is_better` direction is an explicit Phase 1 simplification; the `bounded_optimum` roadmap is Phase 2.

**Consequences:** `ubu-schemas` adds the `affect-profile` schema (the §6 tolerances), narrows the `core/snapshot` affect block to the observation, corrects the `mood_intensity` direction, and adds the legitimization-result fields on the planning response, under this decision. The planning kernel implements `full_legitimize` as the affect filter over the AffectProfile and the observation; the orchestrator builds the AffectProfile from bootstrap Preferences and resolves the observation from the snapshot, sets the affect mode, and surfaces the result; the UI surfaces affect legitimization on the Compact Calendar; the devshell asserts the feasible, infeasible, and stale-affect paths. This record authorizes the schema change; it does not add support-task insertion, `semi_legitimize`, value scoring, or rollout, which are later steps, and `full_legitimize` here covers the affect filter only.

## UBU-D0237 — The kernel contract types are the planning surface; Phase C-1 adds value scoring, bounded candidates, and semi-legitimization

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.2, §16.3.1; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §3, §4, §5; ubu-planning-kernel; ubu-orchestrator; ubu-ui; ubu-devshell; ubu-schemas (removal of the thin planning stubs). Refines `UBU-D0124`, `UBU-D0151`, and `UBU-D0211`; builds on `UBU-D0235` and `UBU-D0236`.

The Phase 1 planning contract surface is the kernel's Rust contract types (`request.rs`, `response.rs`), governed by `PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md`. The thin `ubu-schemas` `planning-request`, `planning-response`, and `task-spec` schemas were development scaffolding, never tracked the contract, are unused by the live planning path, and are deprecated and removed; this is a cleanup, not a contract change.

Phase C-1 implements the deterministic optimization layer. The kernel generates a bounded candidate set — the legitimized skeleton baseline plus up to fifteen deterministic slack-based perturbations seeded by `rng_seed`, capped at sixteen — runs the Phase B affect filter (`full_legitimize`) per candidate, prunes with semi-legitimization (`UBU-D0211`: `passes_cheap_checks`/`reject_obvious`/`needs_full_legitimization` over the Phase 1 heuristic set), and value-scores survivors (utility, affect-margin, schedule-diversity, and an approximate pre-rollout robustness) into a `total_score` composite weighted by `scoring_policy`. The response carries ranked `PlanCandidate`s with `score_summary`, `candidate_role`, `feasibility_summary`, and `semi_legitimization_summary`; `probability_summary` is present but unpopulated until C-2. The default Calendar is the rank-1 candidate by `total_score`, and `next_action` follows it.

The Monte Carlo rollout (Stage 4), shifted-log-normal duration sampling, the §7 correlation matrix, and probability summaries are deferred to C-2. GPU execution is deferred; the §5 tensor profile is advisory and the CPU reference path is authoritative.

**Consequences:** the kernel contract types gain the §3 duration model and `correlation_groups`, the `scoring_policy` weights, and the §4 `PlanCandidate` summaries with a `plan_candidates` response shape; the orchestrator threads `scoring_policy` in and surfaces the ranked candidates and selection; the UI surfaces scores and role-tagged alternatives; the devshell asserts the multi-candidate scoring and selection; and `ubu-schemas` removes the thin planning stubs. This record does not add rollout, probability estimation, or GPU.

## UBU-D0238 — Phase C-2 adds the Monte Carlo rollout, and rollout re-ranks the default Plan

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §15.2.1, §16; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §3, §5, §7; ubu-planning-kernel; ubu-orchestrator; ubu-ui; ubu-devshell. Refines `UBU-D0151` and the §15.2.1 default-by-Plan-probability selection; builds on `UBU-D0237` (value scoring and bounded candidates).

Phase C-2 implements the stochastic robustness layer (`PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md` §5 Stage 4). For the top-K finalists — default three, cap eight, drawn from the C-1 composite ranking — the kernel samples correlated Task durations and estimates feasibility, robustness, and probability.

Duration sampling (§3) is the shifted-log-normal `D = min + LogNormal(mu, sigma)` with the exact derivation (`a = mode-min`, `b = p95-min`, `z95 = 1.6448536269514722`, `sigma = (-z95 + sqrt(z95^2 + 4*ln(b/a)))/2`, `mu = ln(a) + sigma^2`); fixed durations are delta distributions. Correlation (§7) is the positive latent-factor construction `C = L*L^T + diag(1 - row_norm(L)^2)`, positive semi-definite by construction, with any Task's loading norm capped at 0.95 (scaled, with a warning); the CPU validates symmetry, finite values, unit diagonal, strength ranges, the absence of duplicate groups, and PSD factorization before rollout.

The rollout runs `n_rollouts` samples per finalist (default 1000, sample cap 5000; `n_rollouts = 0` skips rollout and reports `probability_quality = not_estimated`, keeping the C-1 proxy). The stage-4 seed is `rng_seed + 3` with deterministic per-finalist substreams; results are byte-exact under a fixed seed. Outputs are the feasibility frequency; `robustness_score` as the p10 lower percentile of the per-rollout outcome (the percentile is a recorded rollout-config parameter); `display_probability` with a Wilson-score `probability_interval_low`/`high`; and `probability_quality` ∈ `full`/`degraded_numeric_jitter`/`degraded_independence`/`not_estimated`. On Cholesky failure the CPU adds diagonal jitter up to an epsilon (`degraded_numeric_jitter`); on persistent failure it rejects when the request sets strict validation, otherwise runs an explicitly degraded independent rollout (`degraded_independence`) with a visible diagnostic; nearest-PSD projection is never used.

Rollout re-ranks the default Plan: after rollout, the composite folds in the rollout robustness and probability, so the §15.2.1 default-by-Plan-probability selection becomes the actual selection rather than the C-1 deterministic proxy, and `next_action` follows the re-ranked default. External-event assumptions remain empty in Phase 1 (deferred with a detailed follow-on); GPU execution is deferred (the §5 tensor profile is advisory; the CPU reference path is authoritative); negative correlations and signed loadings are Phase 2.

**Consequences:** the kernel populates `probability_summary` and `probability_quality`, adds the correlation matrix and the rollout, replaces the proxy robustness with the p10 rollout estimate, and re-ranks the default; the orchestrator threads `n_rollouts`/`top_k`/strict validation and surfaces probability, robustness, and quality; the UI surfaces probability with its Wilson interval, the rollout robustness, and the degraded and not-estimated states; the devshell asserts the rollout, degraded, and re-rank paths. This record does not add external-event modeling, signed correlations, or GPU execution.

## UBU-D0239 — The Task carries an optional duration estimate and correlation-group membership, feeding the rollout

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §9 (Tasks), §15.2.1; PLANNING_KERNEL_CONTRACT.md §3; ubu-schemas (`core/task`), ubu-store, ubu-orchestrator, ubu-devshell. Builds on `UBU-D0237` and `UBU-D0238`, which consume these inputs.

The Phase 1 rollout (`UBU-D0238`) requires per-Task duration uncertainty and correlation structure, but the canonical Task carried no duration estimate and the orchestrator built fixed scalar durations with empty correlation groups, so the rollout only ever saw degenerate fixed input. This decision establishes the input path.

The canonical Task gains an optional `duration_estimate` — either `fixed` (a scalar `seconds`) or the §3 three-point `shifted_lognormal_p95` (`min_seconds`, `mode_seconds`, `p95_seconds`, ordered `0 <= min < mode < p95`) — and an optional `correlation_groups` membership (`[{group, strength in [0,1]}]`, positive loadings, no duplicate groups). Both default to absent: an absent estimate is treated as a fixed default, and absent correlation is independent. Invalid three-point triples are rejected at admission and at request-tensor build, never silently repaired.

The store admits and persists these optional fields. The orchestrator carries them into the kernel `TaskSpec` — from the store Task on the live path and from the request body on the demo and fixture path — mapping to `DurationModel::Fixed` or `DurationModel::ShiftedLognormalP95` and the correlation groups, replacing the prior fixed-scalar and empty-correlation hardcoding. The kernel already accepts these inputs (`UBU-D0237`/`UBU-D0238`); no kernel change is required.

For Phase 1 the estimates are supplied by import, bootstrap, and fixtures; a user-facing editor for three-point estimates and correlation groups is deferred. The stochastic integration smoke test belongs after this input path: the C-2 D11 is re-issued as a minimal duration-agnostic check (candidate retention, `not_estimated`, and `full` quality on a degenerate fixed-duration rollout), and the full stochastic integration test (D12) lands with this slice.

**Consequences:** `ubu-schemas` extends `core/task` with the optional `duration_estimate` and `correlation_groups`; `ubu-store` admits and persists them; `ubu-orchestrator` carries them from the store Task and the request body into the kernel `TaskSpec`; `ubu-devshell` D12 exercises the stochastic rollout, the re-rank, the correlation effect, and `not_estimated` end to end, with the degraded and strict paths verified at the kernel unit level. This record does not add a user-facing estimate editor, external-event modeling, or signed correlations.

## UBU-D0240 — Derived risk and human-complete plan-quality reports

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §2.5.1, §16; ubu-schemas (`api/risk-report` enrichment, new `api/human-complete-plan-quality`), ubu-orchestrator, ubu-ui, ubu-devshell. Builds on `UBU-D0238` (the planning kernel emits the signals these reports aggregate).

Phase 1 adds two derived, non-canonical, recalculable reports: a risk report and a `human_complete_plan_quality` assessment (DESIGN §2.5.1). Both are computed in the orchestrator from the kernel response and store context; neither is a canonical object and the kernel is unchanged.

The reports are computed in the orchestrator, not the kernel. The kernel already emits the plan-intrinsic signals — affect margin, rollout robustness and feasibility, and skeleton failures — and the orchestrator joins them with store context the pure kernel cannot see (Task deadlines, Log history, affect Snapshot freshness, worker status). Planning that carries little risk produces a minimal report without burdening the kernel path.

The thin `api/risk-report` schema is enriched so each finding carries a `category` (`deadline_risk`, `dependency_fragility`, `worker_bottleneck`, `stale_affect`, `affect_margin`, `destructive_pressure`, `post_plan_depletion`, `low_coverage`, `skeleton_failure`), a `severity`, and a `blocking` flag, retaining the top-level `low`/`medium`/`high` level. A new `api/human-complete-plan-quality` schema structures the six §2.5.1 signals — `feedback_latency`, `checkpoint_coverage`, `affect_margin`, `failure_pattern`, `stretch_pressure` (`comfort`/`sustainable_stretch`/`destructive_pressure`), and `post_plan_state_delta` (`better`/`neutral`/`depleted`/`at_risk`) — plus non-blaming `revision_suggestions`. The existing `api/human-complete-report` schema (a user reporting manual task completion) is a different concept and is unchanged.

The affect signals (`affect_margin`, `stretch_pressure`, `post_plan_state_delta`) are derived in the orchestrator from the kernel's existing affect-margin output, behind a single `post_plan_affect_projection` seam. Because the Task model does not yet carry a per-task `affect_delta` field, Phase 1 uses the affect margin as the projection input; a per-task `affect_delta` and a non-linear (clamped, sigmoid) forward affect trajectory — eventually kernel-owned — are deferred behind the seam.

`destructive_pressure`, hard deadline-infeasibility, and recommendation-path skeleton failures are blocking and recalculation-driving (consistent with the §2062 immediate blocking prompt and the §16.2 low-coverage recalculation); all other findings are advisory. `failure_pattern` points only to model causes (estimates, dependencies, stale affect, interruption, overload, changed Objective), never the user, and `revision_suggestions` are framed as model repairs.

**Consequences:** ubu-schemas enriches `api/risk-report` and adds `api/human-complete-plan-quality`; the orchestrator computes both reports from the kernel response and store and drives recalculation on the blocking set; the UI surfaces the level, findings, and the six signals on the Calendar and next-action; the devshell asserts each finding and signal on fixtures. This record adds no kernel change, no canonical object, no per-task `affect_delta` field, no non-linear affect trajectory, no richer growth or longitudinal model, and no live GitHub.

## UBU-D0241 — UniverseState facts container and deterministic precondition/mutation semantics

**Status:** Accepted → DESIGN.md §10.1, §11, §4.1.6; ubu-schemas (`core/universe-state` reshape, new mutation-item and precondition schemas), ubu-core, ubu-store, ubu-devshell. Builds on `UBU-D0229` (which added the `ustate_` prefix and `ObjectType::UniverseState`).

Phase 1 realizes UniverseState as the §11.1 lightweight facts container. At time of record the `core/universe-state` schema and the `ubu-core` type were a dormant objectives+tasks bundle — not the four-collection container the schema description claimed — referenced only by an unused `Option<UniverseState>` planning-request field. This slice reshapes that dormant object into the container of four collections (`facts`, `numeric_values`, `set_memberships`, `event_markers`) plus the shell fields (`id`, `captured_at`, `source_summary`, optional `confidence_summary`), and implements its read and write semantics.

The seven-operation mutation vocabulary (`set_fact`, `clear_fact`, `increment_numeric`, `decrement_numeric`, `add_membership`, `remove_membership`, `append_event_marker`) over dotted targets, and the deterministic precondition evaluator (recursive `all_of`/`any_of` with the three predicates `equals`, `member_of`, `absent` — no numeric comparison in MVP), are implemented as pure functions in `ubu-core` alongside the type, with no store or network dependency. Mutation lists are validated in full before being applied in list order. `increment_numeric`/`decrement_numeric` against a missing key initializes from zero; `append_event_marker` appends a loosely-typed JSON object to a list at the target key. The store admits and persists the container; registry, `ObjectType`, and the admission type-mapping already exist from `UBU-D0229`.

UniverseState is a single current-state object: mutations are applied in place with `captured_at` as valid-at, and mutation history lives in Logs and the containing envelopes (the design places provenance on the envelope, not the mutation item), not in UniverseState versioning. There is no supersession or event-sourcing in MVP.

The container, vocabulary, and evaluator are Compartment-agnostic in this slice (single-user). The design's Compartment policy on Relationship- and affect-related targets, and the redaction-identity invariant (denied Compartment labels never cross a boundary), attach when multi-Compartment fact access is exercised — part of the wiring follow-on, not this slice.

**Consequences:** ubu-schemas reshapes `core/universe-state` and adds the mutation-item and precondition schemas; ubu-core carries the reshaped type plus the evaluator and applicator and repurposes the `planning_request.state` field to carry the facts snapshot; ubu-store admits and persists the container; ubu-devshell exercises admit → mutate → evaluate on fixtures. This record adds no Task `preconditions`/`effects` field, no kernel `unschedulable` evaluation, no effect application on Task completion, no bootstrap fact-recording, no Compartment enforcement, and no live GitHub — those are the wiring follow-on.
